      <bodyTitle>Overall Objectives</bodyTitle>
      <p>Our daily life environment is increasingly interacting with digital
information.
An important amount of this information is of geometric nature.
It concerns the representation of our environment, the analysis
and understanding of “real” phenomena, the control of physical
mechanisms or processes.
The interaction between physical and digital worlds is two-way.
Sensors are producing
digital data related to measurements or observations of our
environment. Digital models are also used to “act” on the physical world.
Objects that we use at home, at work, to travel, such as furniture, cars,
planes, ... are nowadays produced by industrial processes which are based on
digital representation of shapes. CAD-CAM (Computer Aided Design – Computer Aided Manufacturing)
software is used to represent the geometry of these objects and to
control the manufacturing processes which create them.
The construction capabilities themselves are also expanding,
with the development of 3D printers and the possibility to create
daily-life objects “at home” from digital models.</p>
      <p>The impact of geometry is also important in the analysis and
understanding of phenomena. The 3D conformation of a molecule explains
its biological interaction with other molecules. The profile of a wing
determines its aeronautic behavior, while the shape of a bulbous bow
can decrease significantly the wave resistance of a ship.
Understanding such a behavior or analyzing a physical phenomenon can
nowadays be achieved for many problems by numerical simulation. The
precise representation of the geometry and the link between the
geometric models and the numerical computation tools are closely
related to the quality of these simulations. This also plays an
important role in optimisation loops where the numerical simulation
results are used to improve the “performance” of a model.</p>
      <p>Geometry deals with structured and efficient representations of
information and with methods to treat it. Its impact in animation,
games and VAMR (Virtual, Augmented and Mixed Reality) is important. It
also has a growing influence in e-trade where a consumer can evaluate,
test and buy a product from its digital description. Geometric data
produced for instance by 3D scanners and reconstructed models are
nowadays used to memorize old works in cultural or industrial domains.</p>
      <p>Geometry is involved in many domains (manufacturing, simulation,
communication, virtual world...), raising many challenging
questions related to the representations of shapes, to the analysis of
their properties and to the computation with these models.
The stakes are multiple:
the accuracy in numerical engineering, in simulation,
in optimization, the quality in design and manufacturing processes,
the capacity of modeling and analysis of physical problems.

      <bodyTitle>High order geometric modeling</bodyTitle>
      <p>The accurate description of shapes is a long standing problem in
mathematics, with an important impact in many domains, inducing strong
interactions between geometry and computation. Developing precise
geometric modeling techniques is a critical issue in CAD-CAM. Constructing
accurate models, that can be exploited in geometric applications, from
digital data produced by cameras, laser scanners, observations or
simulations is also a major issue in geometry processing. A main
challenge is to construct models that can capture the geometry of
complex shapes, using few parameters while being precise.</p>
      <p>Our first objective is to develop methods, which are able
to describe accurately and in an efficient way, objects or phenomena of
geometric nature, using algebraic representations.</p>
      <p>The approach followed in CAGD, to describe complex geometry is based
on parametric representations called NURBS (Non Uniform Rational
B-Spline). The models are constructed by trimming and gluing together
high order patches of algebraic surfaces.
These models are built from the so-called B-Spline functions
that encode a piecewise algebraic function with a prescribed
regularity at the seams. Although these models have many advantages
and have become the standard for designing nowadays CAD models,they also have important drawbacks. Among them, the difficulty to
locally refine a NURBS surface and also the topological rigidity of NURBS
patches that imposes to use many such patches with trims for designing
complex models, with the consequence of the appearing of cracks at the
seams. To overcome these difficulties, an active area of research is
to look for new blending functions for the representation of CAD
models. Some examples are the so-called T-Splines, LR-Spline blending functions, or hierarchical splines, that have been recently devised
in order to perform efficiently local refinement. An important problem
is to analyze spline spaces associated to general subdivisions,
which is of
particular interest in higher order Finite Element Methods. Another challenge in geometric modeling
is the efficient representation and/or reconstruction of complex objects,
and the description of computational domains in numerical simulation
To construct models that can represent efficiently the geometry of complex shapes,
we are interested in developing modeling methods,
based on alternative constructions such as skeleton-based representations.
The change of representation, in particular between parametric and implicit
representations, is of particular interest in geometric computations
and in its applications in CAGD.</p>
      <p>We also plan to investigate adaptive hierarchical techniques, which can
locally improve the approximation of a shape or a function.
They shall be exploited to transform
digital data produced by cameras, laser scanners, observations or
simulations into accurate and structured algebraic models.</p>
      <p>The precise and efficient representation of shapes also leads to the problem of
extracting and exploiting characteristic properties of shapes such as symmetry,
which is very frequent in geometry.
Reflecting the symmetry of the intended shape in the
representation appears as a natural requirement for visual quality,
but also as a possible source of sparsity of the representation.
Recognizing, encoding and exploiting symmetry requires new paradigms
of representation and further algebraic developments.
Algebraic foundations for the exploitation of symmetry in the context of non
linear differential and polynomial equations are addressed.
The intent is to bring this expertise with symmetry to the geometric
models and computations developed by <span class="smallcap" align="left">aromath</span>.</p>
    </subsection>
    <subsection id="uid6" level="1">
      <bodyTitle>Robust algebraic-geometric computation</bodyTitle>
      <p>In many problems, digital data are approximated and cannot just be
used as if they were exact. In the context of geometric modeling,
polynomial equations appear naturally, as a way to describe
constraints between the unknown variables of a problem. <i>An
important challenge is to take into account the input error in order
to develop robust methods for solving these algebraic constraints.</i>
Robustness means that a small perturbation of the input should produce
a controlled variation of the output, that is forward stability, when
the input-output map is regular. In non-regular cases,
robustness also means that the output is an exact solution, or the
most coherent solution, of a problem with input
data in a given neighborhood, that is backward stability.</p>
      <p>Our second long term objective is to develop methods to
robustly and efficiently solve algebraic problems that occur in
geometric modeling.</p>
      <p>Robustness is a major issue in geometric modeling and algebraic
computation. Classical methods in computer algebra, based on the
paradigm of exact computation, cannot be applied directly in this
context. They are not designed for stability against input
perturbations. New investigations are needed to develop methods, which
integrate this additional dimension of the problem. Several approaches
are investigated to tackle these difficulties.</p>
      <p>One is based on linearization of algebraic problems based on
“elimination of variables” or projection into a space of smaller
dimension. Resultant theory provides strong foundation for these
methods, connecting the geometric properties of the solutions with
explicit linear algebra on polynomial vector spaces, for families of
polynomial systems (e.g., homogeneous, multi-homogeneous, sparse).
Important progresses have been made in the last two decades to extend this
theory to new families of problems with specific geometric properties.
Additional advances
have been achieved more recently to exploit the syzygies between the
input equations. This
approach provides matrix based representations, which are particularly
powerful for approximate geometric computation on parametrized curves
and surfaces. They are tuned to certain classes of problems and an
important issue is to detect and analyze degeneracies and to adapt
them to these cases.</p>
      <p>A more adaptive approach involves linear algebra computation in a
hierarchy of polynomial vector spaces. It produces a description of
quotient algebra structures, from which the solutions of
polynomial systems can be recovered.This family of methods includes Gröbner Basis, which provides general tools for solving polynomial equations.
Border Basis is an alternative approach, offering numerically stable
methods for solving polynomial equations with approximate coefficients. An important issue is to understand and control the
numerical behavior of these methods as well as their complexity and to
exploit the structure of the input system.</p>
      <p>In order to compute “only” the (real) solutions of a polynomial
system in a given domain, duality techniques can also be employed.
They consist in analyzing and adding constraints on the space of linear forms which
vanish on the polynomial equations. Combined with semi-definite
programming techniques, they provide efficient methods to compute the
real solutions of algebraic equations or to solve
polynomial optimization problems.The main issues are the completness of the approach, their scalability
with the degree and dimension and the certification of bounds.</p>
      <p>Singular solutions of polynomial systems can be analyzed by computing
differentials, which vanish at these points. This leads to efficient
deflation techniques, which transform a singular solution of a given
problem into a regular solution of the transformed problem.
These local methods need to be combined with more global root
localisation methods.</p>
      <p>Subdivision methods are another type of methods which are interesting
for robust geometric computation. They are based on exclusion tests
which certify that no solution exits in a domain and inclusion tests,
which certify the uniqueness of a solution in a domain.
They have shown their strength in addressing many algebraic problems,
such as isolating real roots of polynomial equations
or computing the topology of algebraic curves and surfaces.
The main issues in these approaches is to deal with
singularities and degenerate solutions.</p>

    <subsection id="uid8" level="1">
      <bodyTitle>Geometric modeling for Design and Manufacturing.</bodyTitle>
      <p>The main domain of applications that we consider for the methods we
develop is Computer Aided Design and Manufacturing.</p>
      <p>Computer-Aided Design (CAD) involves creating digital models defined
by mathematical constructions, from geometric, functional or aesthetic considerations.
Computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) uses the geometrical design data to
control the tools and processes, which lead to the production of real objects
from their numerical descriptions.</p>
      <p>CAD-CAM systems provide tools for visualizing,
understanding, manipulating, and editing virtual shapes. They are
extensively used in many applications, including automotive,
shipbuilding, aerospace industries, industrial and architectural
design, prosthetics, and many more. They are also widely used to
produce computer animation for special effects in movies, advertising
and technical manuals, or for digital content creation. Their
economic importance is enormous. Their importance in education is
also growing, as they are more and more used in schools and
educational purposes.</p>
      <p>CAD-CAM has been a major driving force for research developments in
geometric modeling, which leads to very large software, produced and sold by big
companies, capable of assisting engineers in all the steps from
design to manufacturing.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, many challenges still need to be addressed.
Many problems remain open,
related to the use of efficient shape representations, of
geometric models specific to some application domains, such as in
architecture, naval engineering, mechanical constructions, manufacturing, ....
Important questions on the robustness and the certification of
geometric computation are not yet answered.
The complexity of the models which are used nowadays also appeal for
the development of new approaches.
The manufacturing environment is also increasingly complex, with new
type of machine tools including: turning, 5 axis machining and wire
EDM (Electrical Discharge Machining), 3D printer. It cannot be properly used without computer
assistance, which raises methodological and algorithmic questions.
There is an increasing need to combine design and simulation, for
analyzing the physical behavior of a model and for optimal design.</p>
      <p>The field has deeply changed over the last decades, with the
emergence of new geometric modeling tools built on dedicated packages,
which are mixing different scientific areas to address specific applications.
It is providing new opportunities to apply new geometric modeling
methods, output from research activities.</p>
    </subsection>
    <subsection id="uid9" level="1">
      <bodyTitle>Geometric modeling for Numerical Simulation and Optimization</bodyTitle>
      <p>A major bottleneck in the CAD-CAM developments is the lack of
interoperability of modeling systems and simulation systems.
This is strongly influenced by their development history,
as they have been following different paths.</p>
      <p>The geometric tools have evolved from supporting a limited number of tasks at
separate stages in product development and manufacturing, to being
essential in all phases from initial design through manufacturing.</p>
      <p>Current Finite Element Analysis (FEA) technology was already well
established 40 years ago, when CAD-systems just started to
appear, and its success stems from using approximations of both the
geometry and the analysis model with low order finite elements (most
often of degree <formula type="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" overflow="scroll"><mrow><mo>≤</mo><mn>2</mn></mrow></math></formula>).</p>
      <p>There has been no requirement between CAD and numerical simulation,
based on Finite Element Analysis, leading to incompatible mathematical
representations in CAD and FEA. This incompatibility makes
interoperability of CAD/CAM and FEA very challenging. In the general
case today this challenge is addressed by expensive and time-consuming
human intervention and software developments.</p>
      <p>Improving this interaction by using adequate geometric and functional
descriptions should boost the interaction between numerical analysis
and geometric modeling, with important implications in shape
optimization. In particular, it could provide a better feedback of numerical
simulations on the geometric model in a design optimization loop, which incorporates
iterative analysis steps.</p>
      <p>The situation is evolving. In the past decade, a new paradigm has emerged to replace the
traditional Finite Elements by B-Spline basis element of any
polynomial degree, thus in principle enabling exact representation of
all shapes that can be modelled in CAD.
It has been demonstrated that the so-called isogeometric analysis approach
can be far more accurate than traditional FEA.</p>
      <p>It opens new perspectives for the interoperability between geometric
modeling and numerical simulation.
The development of numerical methods of high order using a precise
description of the shapes raises questions on piecewise polynomial
elements, on the description of computational domains
and of their interfaces, on the construction of good function
spaces to approximate physical solutions.
All these problems involve geometric considerations and are closely
related to the theory of splines and to the geometric methods we are
investigating. We plan to apply our work to the development of new interactions
between geometric modeling and numerical solvers.</p>

        <span class="smallcap" align="left">Functional Description</span>
      </p>
      <p>Axel is a cross platform software to visualize, manipulate and compute 3D objects. It is composed of a main application and several plugins.
The main application provides atomic geometric data and processes, a
viewer based on VTK, a GUI to handle objects, to select data, to apply process on them and to visualize the results.
The plugins provides more data with their reader, writer, converter
and interactors, more processes on the new or atomic data.
It is written in C++ and thanks to a wrapping system using SWIG,
its data structures and algorithms can be integrated into C# programs, as well as Python.
The software is distributed as a source package, as well as binary
packages for Linux, MacOSX and Windows.</p>

      <p>The paper <ref xlink:href="#aromath-2016-bid1" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/> presents two new constructions related to singular solutions of polynomial systems. The first is a new deflation method for an isolated singular root. This construction uses a single linear differential form defined from the Jacobian matrix of the input, and defines the deflated system by applying this differential form to the original system. The advantages of this new deflation is that it does not introduce new variables and the increase in the number of equations is linear in each iteration instead of the quadratic increase of previous methods. The second construction gives the coefficients of the so-called inverse system or dual basis, which defines the multiplicity structure at the singular root. We present a system of equations in the original variables plus a relatively small number of new variables that completely deflates the root in one step. We show that the isolated simple solutions of this new system correspond to roots of the original system with given multiplicity structure up to a given order. Both constructions are "exact " in that they permit one to treat all conjugate roots simultaneously and can be used in certification procedures for singular roots and their multiplicity structure with respect to an exact rational polynomial system.</p>

      <p>We describe a new method to compute general cubature formulae <ref xlink:href="#aromath-2016-bid2" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>. The
problem is initially transformed into the computation of truncated
Hankel operators with flat extensions. We then analyse the algebraic
properties associated to flat extensions and show how to recover the
cubature points and weights from the truncated Hankel operator. We
next present an algorithm to test the flat extension property and to
additionally compute the decomposition. To generate cubature formulae
with a minimal number of points, we propose a new relaxation hierarchy
of convex optimization problems minimizing the nuclear norm of the
Hankel operators. For a suitably high order of convex relaxation, the
minimizer of the optimization problem corresponds to a cubature
formula. Furthermore cubature formulae with a minimal number of points
are associated to faces of the convex sets. We illustrate our method
on some examples, and for each we obtain a new minimal cubature
formula.</p>

      <p>In the paper <ref xlink:href="#aromath-2016-bid3" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>, we analyze the space of geometrically continuous piecewise polynomial functions or splines for quadrangular and triangular patches with arbitrary topology and general rational transition maps. To define these spaces of G<formula type="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" overflow="scroll"><msup><mrow/><mn>1</mn></msup></math></formula> spline functions, we introduce the concept of topological surface with gluing data attached to the edges shared by faces. The framework does not require manifold constructions and is general enough to allow non-orientable surfaces. We describe compatibility conditions on the transition maps so that the space of differentiable functions is ample and show that these conditions are necessary and sufficient to construct ample spline spaces. We determine the dimension of the space of G<formula type="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" overflow="scroll"><msup><mrow/><mn>1</mn></msup></math></formula> spline functions which are of degree <formula type="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" overflow="scroll"><mi>k</mi></math></formula> on triangular pieces and of bi-degree <formula type="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" overflow="scroll"><mrow><mo>(</mo><mi>k</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>k</mi><mo>)</mo></mrow></math></formula> on quadrangular pieces, for <formula type="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" overflow="scroll"><mi>k</mi></math></formula> big enough.

the computation of border bases and the solutions of polynomial

algorithm and the other methods implemented in this package:
numerical solutions from multiplication matrices, real radical
computation, polynomial optimization. The implementation
parameterized by the coefficient type and the choice function
provides a versatile family of tools for polynomial computation with modular
arithmetic, floating point arithmetic or rational arithmetic. It
relies on linear algebra solvers for dense and sparse matrices for
these various types of coefficients. A connection with SDP solvers
has been integrated for the combination of relaxation approaches
with border basis computation. Extensive benchmarks on typical
polynomial systems are reported, which show the very good
performance of the tool.</p>

invariants of the linear action of a finite abelian group in the
nonmodular case. By diagonalization, such a group action can be
described by integer matrices of orders and exponents. We make use of
integer linear algebra to compute a minimal generating set of
invariants along with the substitution needed to rewrite any invariant
in terms of this generating set. In addition, we show how to construct
a minimal generating set that consists only of polynomial
invariants. As an application, we provide a symmetry reduction scheme
for polynomial systems whose solution set is invariant by a finite
abelian group action. Finally, we also provide an algorithm to find
such symmetries given a polynomial system.</p>

A careful treatment of degenerate cases makes our approach robust to intersection points with multiple pre-images. We then apply our intersection algorithm to mesh NURBS surfaces through Delaunay refinement. We demonstrate the added value of our approach in terms of accuracy and treatment of degenerate cases, by providing comparisons with other intersection approaches as well as a variety of meshing experiments.</p>

Our main objective is to investigate birationality criteria for such maps. First, a general criterion is given in terms of the rank of a couple of matrices that became to be known as <i>Jacobian dual matrices</i>. Then, we focus on rational maps from <formula type="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" overflow="scroll"><mrow><msup><mi>ℙ</mi><mn>1</mn></msup><mo>×</mo><msup><mi>ℙ</mi><mn>1</mn></msup></mrow></math></formula> to <formula type="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" overflow="scroll"><msup><mi>ℙ</mi><mn>2</mn></msup></math></formula> in very low bidegrees and provide new matrix-based birationality criteria by analyzing the syzygies of the defining equations of the map, in particular by looking at the dimension of certain bigraded parts of the syzygy module. Finally, applications of our results to the context of geometric modeling are discussed at the end of the paper.</p>

      <p>In <ref xlink:href="#aromath-2016-bid12" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>, we describe a new parametric modeller for an automatic shape optimization loop.
The modeller enables the generation of shapes by selecting a set of design parameters that controls a twofold parameterization: geometrical – based on a skeleton approach – and architectural – based on the experience of practitioners, to impact the system performance. The resulting forms are relevant and effective, thanks to a smoothing procedure that ensures the consistency of the shapes produced.</p>
      <p>The skeleton consists of a set of B-Spline curves composed of a generating curve and section curves. The deformation of the shape is performed by changing explicit parameters of the representation or implicit parameters such as architectural parameters. The new shape is obtained by minimizing a distance function between the current parameters and the target parameters in combination with a smoothing term to ensure shape consistency. Finally, a 3D surface is reconstructed around the skeleton with an iterative method handling multi-patches and boundary constraints.</p>
      <p>Thanks to this approach, architects can directly use a CAD-model based on NURBS representations in the modeller tool that allows a straightforward modification of the initial design to improve performance. The methodology developed can be applied to any shape that can be described by a skeleton, e.g. hulls, foils, bulbous bows, but also wind turbines, airships, etc.</p>
      <p>As application, we consider the optimization of the shape of a bulbous bow. The modeller is linked to the RANSE-CFD solver FINE/Marine. The aim is to reduce the total drag of the hull with variation of its bulbous bow shape.</p>

The formulation of the exterior potential-flow problem reduces to a Boundary-Integral Equation (BIE) for the associated velocity potential exploiting the null-pressure jump Kutta condition at the trailing edge. The numerical solution of the BIE is performed by an Isogeometric Boundary-Element Method (BEM) combining a generic B-splines parametric modeler for generating hydrofoil shapes, using a set of eight parameters, the very same basis of the geometric representation for representing the velocity potential and collocation at the Greville abscissas of the knot vector of the hydrofoil's B-splines representation. Furthermore, the optimization environment is developed based on the geometric parametric modeler for the hydrofoil, the Isogeometric BEM solver and an optimizer employing a controlled elitist genetic algorithm. Multi-objective hydrofoil shape optimization examples are demonstrated with respect to the criteria i) maximum lift coefficient and ii) minimum deviation of the hydrofoil area from a reference area.</p>

The method is illustrated by the study of capillary-gravity steady surface waves propagating in shallow water. We consider the (fully nonlinear, weakly dispersive) Serre-Green-Naghdi equations with surface tension, because it provides a tractable model that, in the same time, is not too simple so the interest of the method can be emphasised. In particular, we analyse a special class of solutions, the solitary waves, which play an important role in many fields of Physics. In capillary-gravity regime, there are two kinds of localised infinitely smooth travelling wave solutions – solitary waves of elevation and of depression. However, if we allow the solitary waves to have an angular point, the “zoology” of solutions becomes much richer and the main goal of this study is to provide a complete classification of such singular localised solutions using the methods of the effective Algebraic Geometry.</p>

        <p>Finding biomarkers of abnormalities of the white matter is one important
problem in dMRI processing. As these biomarkers need to be independent
of the orientation of the head, they are functions of the rotational
invariants of the shapes that characterize the diffusion probabilities in
the white matter. While the situation is well understood for second
order tensors, these are not powerful enough to represent crossings in the
white matter. Acquisitions made with the HARDI scheme allow for a richer
description of probabilities. In particular, the project-team <span class="smallcap" align="left">Athena</span>
has modelled them as (positive) ternary quartics (symmetric tensors of order 4).
But invariants of these quartics are not well known.
For a long period, only six were known, when there should be at least 12.
Strategies were developed in the
project-team <span class="smallcap" align="left">Athena</span> to compute more invariants, either
algebraic <ref xlink:href="#aromath-2016-bid15" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/> or
polynomial <ref xlink:href="#aromath-2016-bid16" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>.
The former suffered some instability issues in their evaluations, the
latter did not form a minimal set.
The goal of this "Transverse action" was to team up with
expertise in algebraic computation and leverage the methods

ARCADES aims at disrupting the traditional paradigm in Computer-Aided Design (CAD) by exploiting cutting-edge research in mathematics and algorithm design. Geometry is now a critical tool in a large number of key applications; somewhat surprisingly, however, several approaches of the CAD industry are outdated, and 3D geometry processing is becoming increasingly the weak link. This is alarming in sectors where CAD faces new challenges arising from fast point acquisition, big data, and mobile computing, but also in robotics, simulation, animation, fabrication and manufacturing, where CAD strives to address crucial societal and market needs. The challenge taken up by ARCADES is to invert the trend of CAD industry lagging behind mathematical breakthroughs and to build the next generation of CAD software based on strong foundations from algebraic geometry, differential geometry, scientific computing, and algorithm design. Our game-changing methods lead to real-time modelers for architectural geometry and visualisation, to isogeometric and design-through-analysis software for shape optimisation, and marine design &amp; hydrodynamics, and to tools for motion design, robot kinematics, path planning, and control of machining tools.</p>

          <p>We coordinate a research project which
is funded by the regional program Math-AmSud for two years : 2015-2016. This project is composed by research teams
from Argentina, Universidad de Buenos Aires (Nicolás Botbol, Alicia
Dickenstein), Brazil, Universidade Federal de Rio de Janeiro, de
Pernambuco e de Sergipe (Sayed Hamid Hassanzadeh, Aron Simis) and
France, Institut de Mathématiques de Jussieu (Marc Chardin) and the Inria project-team AROMATH.</p>
          <p>The study of rational maps is of theoretical interest in algebraic geometry and commutative algebra, and of practical importance in geometric modeling. This research proposal focuses on rational maps in low dimension, typically parameterizations of curves and surfaces embedded in the projective space of dimension three, but also dominant rational maps in dimension two and three. The two main objectives amount to unravel geometric properties of these rational maps from the syzygies of their projective coordinates. The first one aims at extending and generalizing the determination of the closed image of a rational map, as well as its geometric features, whereas the second one will focus on the study of dominant rational maps, in particular on the characterization of those that are generically one-to-one.</p>
