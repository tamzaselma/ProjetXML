      <bodyTitle>Overall Objectives</bodyTitle>
      <p>Motion planning is not only a crucial issue in control theory, but also a widespread task of all sort of human activities.
The aim of the project-team is to study the various aspects preceding and framing <i>motion planning</i>: accessibility analysis (determining which configurations are attainable), criteria to make choice among possible trajectories, trajectory tracking (fixing a possibly unfeasible trajectory and following it as closely as required), performance analysis (determining the cost of a tracking strategy), design of implementable algorithms,
robustness of a control strategy with respect to computationally motivated discretizations, etc.
The viewpoint that we adopt comes from geometric control:
our main interest is in
qualitative and intrinsic properties and our focus is on trajectories (either individual ones or families of them).</p>
      <p>The main application domain of GECO
is <i>quantum control</i>.
The importance of designing efficient transfers between
different
atomic or molecular levels in atomic and molecular physics
is due to its applications to
photochemistry (control by laser pulses of chemical reactions), nuclear magnetic resonance (control by a magnetic field of spin dynamics)
and, on a more distant time horizon,
the strategic
domain of
quantum computing.</p>
      <p>A second application area
concerns the control interpretation of phenomena appearing in <i>neurophysiology</i>.
It studies
the modeling of the mechanisms supervising
some biomechanics actions or sensorial reactions such as image reconstruction by the primary visual cortex, eyes movement and body
motion.
All these problems can be seen as motion planning
tasks accomplished by the brain.</p>
      <p>As a third applicative domain we propose
a system dynamics approach to <i>switched systems</i>.
Switched systems are characterized by
the interaction of continuous dynamics (physical system) and
discrete/logical components.
They provide a popular modeling framework for
heterogeneous aspects
issuing from
automotive and transportation industry, energy
management and factory automation.</p>

      <p>The main research topic of the project-team is
<b>geometric control</b>, with a special focus on <b>control design</b>.
The application areas that we target are control of
quantum mechanical systems,
neurogeometry and
switched
systems.</p>
      <p>Geometric control theory provides a viewpoint and several tools, issued in particular from
differential geometry, to tackle
typical questions arising in the control framework:
controllability, observability, stabilization, optimal control... <ref xlink:href="#geco-2016-bid0" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>, <ref xlink:href="#geco-2016-bid1" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/> The geometric control approach is particularly well suited
for systems involving
nonlinear and nonholonomic
phenomena.
We recall that nonholonomicity
refers to the property of
a velocity constraint that is not equivalent to a state constraint.</p>
      <p>The expression <b>control design</b> refers here to all phases of the
construction of a control law, in a mainly open-loop perspective:
modeling, controllability analysis, output tracking, motion planning, simultaneous control algorithms, tracking algorithms,
performance comparisons for control and tracking algorithms, simulation and implementation.</p>
      <p>We recall that</p>
      <simplelist>
        <li id="uid6">
          <p noindent="true"><b>controllability</b> denotes the property of a system for which any two states can be connected by a trajectory corresponding to an admissible control law ;</p>
        </li>
        <li id="uid7">
          <p noindent="true"><b>output tracking</b> refers to a control strategy aiming at keeping the value of some functions of the state arbitrarily close to a prescribed time-dependent profile. A typical example is <b>configuration tracking</b> for a mechanical system, in which the controls act as forces and
one prescribes the position variables along the trajectory, while the evolution of the momenta is free. One can think for instance at the lateral movement of a car-like vehicle: even if such a movement is unfeasible, it can be tracked with arbitrary precision by applying a suitable control strategy;</p>
        </li>
        <li id="uid8">
          <p noindent="true"><b>motion planning</b> is the expression usually denoting the algorithmic strategy for selecting one control law steering the system from a given initial state to an attainable final one;</p>
        </li>
        <li id="uid9">
          <p noindent="true"><b>simultaneous control</b> concerns algorithms that aim at driving the system from two different initial conditions, with the same control law and over the same time interval, towards two given final states (one can think, for instance, at some control action on a fluid whose goal is to steer simultaneously two floating bodies.)
Clearly, the study of which pairs (or <formula type="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" overflow="scroll"><mi>n</mi></math></formula>-uples) of states can be simultaneously connected thanks to an admissible control requires an additional controllability analysis with respect to the plain controllability mentioned above.</p>
        </li>
      </simplelist>
      <p>At the core of control design is then the notion of motion planning.
Among the motion planning methods,
a preeminent role is played by
those based on the Lie algebra associated with the control system
( <ref xlink:href="#geco-2016-bid2" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>, <ref xlink:href="#geco-2016-bid3" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>, <ref xlink:href="#geco-2016-bid4" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>), those exploiting the possible flatness of the system ( <ref xlink:href="#geco-2016-bid5" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>) and those based on the continuation method ( <ref xlink:href="#geco-2016-bid6" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>).
Optimal control is clearly another method for choosing a control law connecting two states, although it generally introduces new computational and theoretical difficulties.</p>
      <p>Control systems with special structure, which are very important for applications
are those for which the controls appear linearly. When the controls are not bounded, this means that the admissible velocities form a distribution in the tangent bundle to the state manifold. If the distribution is equipped with a smoothly varying norm (representing a cost of the control), the resulting geometrical structure is called
<i>sub-Riemannian</i>.
Sub-Riemannian geometry thus appears as the underlying geometry of the nonholonomic control systems, playing the same role as Euclidean geometry for linear systems. As such, its study is fundamental for control design. Moreover its importance goes far beyond control theory and is an active field of research both in differential geometry ( <ref xlink:href="#geco-2016-bid7" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>), geometric measure theory ( <ref xlink:href="#geco-2016-bid8" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>, <ref xlink:href="#geco-2016-bid9" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>) and hypoelliptic operator theory ( <ref xlink:href="#geco-2016-bid10" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>).</p>
      <p>Other important classes of control systems are those
modeling mechanical systems.
The dynamics are naturally defined on the tangent or cotangent bundle of the configuration manifold, they have Lagrangian or Hamiltonian structure, and the controls act as forces. When the controls appear linearly, the resulting model can be seen somehow as a second-order sub-Riemannian structure (see <ref xlink:href="#geco-2016-bid11" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>).</p>
      <p>The control design topics presented above naturally extend to the case of distributed parameter control systems. The geometric approach to control systems governed by
partial differential equations is a novel subject with great potential. It could
complement purely analytical and numerical approaches, thanks to its more dynamical, qualitative and intrinsic point of view.
An interesting example of this approach is the paper <ref xlink:href="#geco-2016-bid12" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/> about the controllability of Navier–Stokes equation by low forcing modes.</p>

      <bodyTitle>Quantum control</bodyTitle>
      <p>The issue of designing efficient transfers between
different
atomic or molecular levels is crucial in atomic and molecular physics,
in particular because of its importance in those fields such as
photochemistry (control by laser pulses of chemical reactions), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR, control by a magnetic field of spin dynamics)
and, on a more distant time horizon,
the strategic
domain of
quantum computing.
This last application
explicitly relies on the design
of quantum gates, each of them being, in essence,
an open loop
control law devoted to a prescribed
simultaneous control action. NMR is one of the most promising techniques for the implementation of a quantum computer.</p>
      <p>Physically, the control action
is realized by
exciting the quantum system
by means of one or several external fields, being them magnetic or electric fields.
The resulting control problem has attracted increasing attention,
especially among quantum physicists and chemists (see, for instance, <ref xlink:href="#geco-2016-bid13" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>, <ref xlink:href="#geco-2016-bid14" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>).
The rapid evolution of the domain is driven by
a multitude of
experiments getting more and more precise and complex (see the recent review <ref xlink:href="#geco-2016-bid15" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>). Control strategies have been proposed and implemented, both on numerical simulations and on physical systems,
but there is still a large gap to fill before
getting a complete picture of the control properties of quantum systems. Control techniques should necessarily be
innovative, in order to take into account the physical peculiarities of the model and the specific experimental constraints.</p>
      <p>The area where the picture got clearer
is given by finite dimensional linear closed models.</p>
      <simplelist>
        <li id="uid12">
          <p noindent="true"><b>Finite dimensional</b> refers to the dimension of the space of wave functions, and, accordingly, to the finite number of energy levels.</p>
        </li>
        <li id="uid13">
          <p noindent="true"><b>Linear</b> means that the evolution of the system for a fixed (constant in time) value of the control is determined by a linear vector field.</p>
        </li>
        <li id="uid14">
          <p noindent="true"><b>Closed</b> refers to the fact that the systems are assumed to be totally disconnected from
the environment, resulting in the conservation of
the norm of the wave function.</p>
        </li>
      </simplelist>
      <p>The resulting
model
is well suited for describing spin systems and also arises naturally when infinite dimensional quantum systems of the type discussed below are replaced
by their finite dimensional Galerkin approximations.
Without seeking exhaustiveness, let us mention some
of the issues that have been tackled for finite dimensional linear closed quantum systems:</p>

      <p>Several of these results use suitable transformations or approximations (for instance the so-called rotating wave) to reformulate the finite-dimensional Schrödinger equation as a sub-Riemannian system.
Open systems have also been the object of an intensive
research activity (see, for instance, <ref xlink:href="#geco-2016-bid24" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>, <ref xlink:href="#geco-2016-bid25" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>, <ref xlink:href="#geco-2016-bid26" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>, <ref xlink:href="#geco-2016-bid27" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>).</p>
      <p>In the case where the state space is infinite dimensional,
some optimal control results are known (see, for instance, <ref xlink:href="#geco-2016-bid28" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>, <ref xlink:href="#geco-2016-bid29" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>, <ref xlink:href="#geco-2016-bid30" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>, <ref xlink:href="#geco-2016-bid31" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>).
The controllability issue is less understood than in the finite dimensional setting, but
several advances should be mentioned.
First of all, it is known
that one cannot expect exact controllability on the whole Hilbert sphere <ref xlink:href="#geco-2016-bid32" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>.
Moreover, it has been shown that a relevant model, the quantum oscillator, is not even approximately controllable <ref xlink:href="#geco-2016-bid33" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>, <ref xlink:href="#geco-2016-bid34" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>.
These negative results have been more recently completed by positive ones.
In <ref xlink:href="#geco-2016-bid35" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>, <ref xlink:href="#geco-2016-bid36" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>
Beauchard and Coron obtained the first positive controllability result for a quantum particle in a 1D potential well.
The result is highly nontrivial and is based on Coron's return method (see <ref xlink:href="#geco-2016-bid37" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>).
Exact controllability is proven to hold among regular enough wave functions. In particular, exact controllability among eigenfunctions of the uncontrolled Schrödinger operator can be achieved. Other important approximate controllability results have then been proved using Lyapunov methods <ref xlink:href="#geco-2016-bid38" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>, <ref xlink:href="#geco-2016-bid39" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>, <ref xlink:href="#geco-2016-bid40" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>. While <ref xlink:href="#geco-2016-bid38" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/> studies a controlled Schrödinger equation in <formula type="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" overflow="scroll"><mi>ℝ</mi></math></formula> for which the uncontrolled Schrödinger operator has mixed spectrum, <ref xlink:href="#geco-2016-bid39" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>, <ref xlink:href="#geco-2016-bid40" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/> deal mainly with general discrete-spectrum Schrödinger operators.</p>
      <p>In all the positive results recalled in the previous paragraph, the quantum system is steered by a single external field.
Different techniques can be applied in the case of two or more external fields, leading to additional controllability results
<ref xlink:href="#geco-2016-bid41" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>, <ref xlink:href="#geco-2016-bid42" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>.</p>
      <p>The picture is even
less clear for
nonlinear models, such as Gross–Pitaevski and Hartree–Fock
equations. The obstructions to exact controllability, similar to the ones mentioned in the linear case, have been discussed in <ref xlink:href="#geco-2016-bid43" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>.
Optimal control approaches have also been considered <ref xlink:href="#geco-2016-bid44" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>, <ref xlink:href="#geco-2016-bid45" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>. A comprehensive controllability analysis of such models is probably
a long way away.</p>

      <bodyTitle>Neurophysiology</bodyTitle>
      <p>At the interface between
neurosciences, mathematics, automatics and humanoid robotics,
an entire new approach to neurophysiology is emerging.
It arouses a strong interest in the four communities and its development requires
a joint effort and the sharing of complementary tools.</p>
      <p>A family of extremely interesting problems concerns
the understanding of the mechanisms supervising
some sensorial reactions or biomechanics actions such as image reconstruction by the primary visual cortex, eyes movement and body
motion.</p>
      <p>In order to study these phenomena, a promising approach consists in
identifying the motion planning
problems undertaken by the brain, through the analysis of the
strategies that it applies when
challenged by external inputs. The role of control is that of a
language allowing to read and model neurological phenomena.

so-called neurogeometry <ref xlink:href="#geco-2016-bid46" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>)
and on the functional organization

          <p noindent="true">A challenging problem is that of the understanding of
the mechanisms which are responsible for the process of image reconstruction
in the primary visual cortex V1.</p>
          <p>The visual cortex areas composing V1 are notable for their complex
spatial organization and their functional
diversity.
Understanding and describing their architecture requires sophisticated
modeling
tools.
At the same time, the structure of the natural and
artificial images used in visual psychophysics can be fully
disclosed only using rather deep geometric concepts. The word
“geometry" refers here to the internal geometry of the
functional architecture of visual cortex areas (not to the geometry of
the Euclidean external space). Differential geometry and analysis
both play a fundamental role in the description of the structural
characteristics of visual perception.</p>
          <p>A model of human perception based on a simplified description of the
visual cortex V1, involving geometric objects typical of control theory
and sub-Riemannian geometry, has been first proposed
by Petitot ( <ref xlink:href="#geco-2016-bid47" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>) and then modified by
Citti and Sarti ( <ref xlink:href="#geco-2016-bid48" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>). The model is based on
experimental observations, and in particular on the fundamental work
by Hubel and Wiesel <ref xlink:href="#geco-2016-bid49" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/> who received the Nobel prize in 1981.</p>
          <p>In this model, neurons of V1 are grouped into orientation columns,
each of them being sensitive to visual stimuli arriving at a given point of the
retina and oriented along a given direction. The retina is modeled by the real
plane, while the directions at a given point are modeled by the
projective line. The fiber bundle having as base the real plane and
as fiber the projective line is called the <i>bundle of directions of
the plane</i>.</p>
          <p>From the neurological point of view, orientation columns are in turn
grouped into hypercolumns, each of them sensitive to stimuli arriving at a
given point, oriented along any direction. In the same hypercolumn, relative to a
point of the plane, we also find neurons that are sensitive to other
stimuli properties, such as colors.
Therefore, in this model the visual cortex treats an image not as a
planar object, but as a set of points in the bundle of directions of the
plane.
The reconstruction is then realized by minimizing the energy necessary
to activate orientation columns among those which are not activated directly by
the image.
This gives rise to a sub-Riemannian problem on the bundle of directions
of the plane.</p>

          <p noindent="true">Another class of challenging problems
concern the
functional organization
of the motor pathways.</p>
          <p>The interest in establishing a model of the motor pathways, at the
same time mathematically rigorous and biologically plausible,
comes from the possible spillovers in robotics and neurophysiology.
It could help
to
design better control strategies for robots and artificial limbs, yielding smoother and more progressive
movements.
Another underlying relevant societal goal (clearly beyond our domain of expertise)
is to clarify the mechanisms of
certain debilitating troubles
such as cerebellar disease, chorea and Parkinson's disease.</p>
          <p>A key issue in order to
establish a model of the motor pathways is to
determine the criteria underlying the brain's choices.
For instance, for the problem of
human locomotion (see <ref xlink:href="#geco-2016-bid50" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>), identifying such criteria would be crucial to understand the neural
pathways implicated in the generation of locomotion
trajectories.</p>
          <p>A nowadays widely accepted paradigm is
that, among all possible movements, the
accomplished ones satisfy suitable optimality criteria
(see <ref xlink:href="#geco-2016-bid51" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/> for a review). One is then led to study an
inverse optimal control problem: starting from a database of
experimentally recorded movements, identify a cost function such that
the corresponding optimal solutions are compatible with the observed
behaviors.</p>
          <p>Different methods have been taken into account in the
literature to tackle this kind of problems, for instance in the linear
quadratic case <ref xlink:href="#geco-2016-bid52" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/> or for Markov processes <ref xlink:href="#geco-2016-bid53" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>.
However all these methods
have been conceived for very specific systems and they are not
suitable in the general case.
Two approaches are possible to overcome this difficulty. The direct approach consists in choosing
a cost function among a class of functions naturally adapted to the
dynamics (such as energy functions) and to compare the solutions of
the corresponding optimal control problem to the experimental data. In
particular one needs to compute, numerically or analytically, the
optimal trajectories and to choose suitable criteria (quantitative
and qualitative) for the comparison with observed trajectories.
The inverse approach consists in deriving the cost function from the
qualitative analysis of the data.</p>

      <bodyTitle>Switched systems</bodyTitle>
      <p>Switched systems form a subclass of hybrid systems, which themselves constitute a key growth area in automation and communication technologies with a broad
range of applications. Existing and emerging areas include automotive and transportation industry, energy
management and factory automation.
The notion of hybrid systems
provides a framework adapted to the description
of the heterogeneous aspects related to the interaction of continuous dynamics (physical system) and
discrete/logical components.</p>
      <p>The characterizing feature of switched systems is
the collective aspect of the dynamics.
A typical question is that of
stability, in which one wants to determine whether a dynamical system whose evolution is
influenced by a time-dependent signal is uniformly stable
with respect to all signals in a fixed class ( <ref xlink:href="#geco-2016-bid54" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>).</p>
      <p>The theory of finite-dimensional hybrid and switched systems has been the subject of
intensive research in the last decade and a large number of diverse and challenging problems such as stabilizability, observability, optimal control and synchronization have been
investigated (see for instance <ref xlink:href="#geco-2016-bid55" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>, <ref xlink:href="#geco-2016-bid56" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>).</p>
      <p>The question of stability, in particular, because of its
relevance for applications, has spurred a rich literature. Important contributions
concern the notion of common Lyapunov function: when there exists a Lyapunov function that decays along all possible modes of the system (that is, for every possible constant value of the signal), then the system is uniformly asymptotically stable. Conversely, if the system is stable uniformly with respect to all signals switching in an arbitrary way, then a common Lyapunov function exists <ref xlink:href="#geco-2016-bid57" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>.
In the <i>linear</i> finite-dimensional case,
the existence of a common Lyapunov function
is actually equivalent to the
global uniform exponential
stability of the system <ref xlink:href="#geco-2016-bid58" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/> and, provided that the admissible modes are finitely many,
the Lyapunov function can be taken polyhedral or polynomial
<ref xlink:href="#geco-2016-bid59" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>, <ref xlink:href="#geco-2016-bid60" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>, <ref xlink:href="#geco-2016-bid61" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>.
A special role in the switched control literature has been played by common
quadratic Lyapunov functions, since their existence can be tested rather efficiently (see <ref xlink:href="#geco-2016-bid62" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/> and references therein).
Algebraic approaches to prove the stability of switched systems under arbitrary switching, not relying on Lyapunov techniques, have been proposed in <ref xlink:href="#geco-2016-bid63" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>, <ref xlink:href="#geco-2016-bid64" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>.</p>
      <p>Other interesting issues concerning the stability of switched systems arise when, instead of considering arbitrary switching, one restricts the class of admissible signals, by imposing, for instance, a dwell time constraint <ref xlink:href="#geco-2016-bid65" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>.</p>
      <p>Another rich area of research concerns discrete-time switched systems, where new intriguing phenomena
appear, preventing the algebraic characterization of stability even for small dimensions of the state space <ref xlink:href="#geco-2016-bid66" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>. It is known that, in this context, stability cannot be tested on periodic signals alone
<ref xlink:href="#geco-2016-bid67" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>.</p>
      <p>Finally, let us mention
that little is known about
infinite-dimensional switched system, with the exception of
some results on uniform asymptotic stability
( <ref xlink:href="#geco-2016-bid68" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>, <ref xlink:href="#geco-2016-bid69" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>, <ref xlink:href="#geco-2016-bid70" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>)
and some recent papers on optimal control ( <ref xlink:href="#geco-2016-bid71" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>, <ref xlink:href="#geco-2016-bid72" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>).</p>

      </p>
      <p><i>ARTIV1 INPAINTING</i> is a software for reconstruction of corrupted and damaged images. One of the main features of the algorithm on which the software is based is that it does not require any information about the location and character of the corrupted places. Another important advantage is that this method is massively parallelizable, this allows to work with sufficiently large images. Theoretical background of the presented method is based on the model of geometry of vision due to Petitot, Citti and Sarti. The main step is numerical solution of the equation of 3D hypoelliptic diffusion.
A new version of the software has just be submitted for protection at APP (Agence pour la protection des programmes).</p>

The main result is that all these coefficients are encoded in the asymptotic expansion of the horizontal derivatives of the sub-Riemannian distance.

we study spectral properties of the Laplace–Beltrami operator on two relevant almost-Riemannian manifolds, namely the Grushin structures on the cylinder and on the sphere. As for general almost-Riemannian structures (under certain technical hypothesis), the singular set acts as a barrier for the evolution of the heat and of a quantum particle, although geodesics can cross it. This is a consequence of the self-adjointness of the Laplace–Beltrami operator on each connected component of the manifolds without the singular set. We get explicit descriptions of the spectrum, of the eigenfunctions and their properties. In particular in both cases we get a Weyl law with dominant term <formula type="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" overflow="scroll"><mrow><mi>E</mi><mo form="prefix">log</mo><mi>E</mi></mrow></math></formula>. We then study the effect of an Aharonov-Bohm non-apophantic magnetic potential that has a drastic effect on the spectral properties. Other generalized Riemannian structures including conic and anti-conic type manifolds are also studied. In this case, the Aharonov-Bohm magnetic potential may affect the self-adjointness of the Laplace-Beltrami operator.</p>

We consider walks on both Riemannian and sub-Riemannian manifolds in which the steps consist of travel along either geodesics or integral curves associated to orthonormal frames, and we give particular attention to walks where the choice of step is influenced by a volume on the manifold. A primary motivation is to explore how one can pass, in the parabolic scaling limit, from geodesics, orthonormal frames, and/or volumes to diffusions, and hence their infinitesimal generators, on sub-Riemannian manifolds, which is interesting in light of the fact that there is no completely canonical notion of sub-Laplacian on a general sub-Riemannian manifold. However, even in the Riemannian case, this random walk approach illuminates the geometric significance of Ito and Stratonovich stochastic differential equations as well as the role played by the volume.</p>

Pliability happens to be related to rigidity as defined by Bryant an Hsu. We exploit this relation in order to provide examples of non-pliable Carnot groups, that is, Carnot groups so that the Whitney extension property does not hold. We use geometric control theory results on the accessibility of control affine systems in order to test the pliability of a Carnot group.</p>

we propose a supervised object recognition method using new global features and inspired by the model of the human primary visual cortex V1 as the semidiscrete roto-translation group <formula type="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" overflow="scroll"><mrow><mtext>SE</mtext><mrow><mo>(</mo><mn>2</mn><mo>,</mo><mi>N</mi><mo>)</mo></mrow><mo>=</mo><msub><mi>ℤ</mi><mi>N</mi></msub><mo>⋊</mo><msup><mi>ℝ</mi><mn>2</mn></msup></mrow></math></formula>. The proposed technique is based on generalized Fourier descriptors on the latter group, which are invariant to natural geometric transformations (rotations, translations). These descriptors are then used to feed an SVM classifier. We have tested our method against the COIL-100 image database and the ORL face database, and compared it with other techniques based on traditional descriptors, global and local. The obtained results have shown that our approach looks extremely efficient and stable to noise, in presence of which it outperforms the other techniques it has been compared with.</p>

The <formula type="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" overflow="scroll"><mi>N</mi></math></formula> equations are coupled through a linear mixing of their values at <formula type="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" overflow="scroll"><mi>O</mi></math></formula>, described by a matrix <formula type="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" overflow="scroll"><mi>M</mi></math></formula>. The activity of the intermittent damping is determined by persistently exciting signals, all belonging to a fixed class. The main result is that, under suitable hypotheses on <formula type="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" overflow="scroll"><mi>M</mi></math></formula> and on the rationality of the ratios between the lengths of the circles, such a system is exponentially stable, uniformly with respect to the persistently exciting signals. The proof relies on a representation formula for the solutions of this system, which allows one to track down the effects of the intermittent damping.
A similar representation formula is used in <ref xlink:href="#geco-2016-bid89" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/> to study the relative controllability of linear difference equations with multiple delays in the state. Thanks to such formula, we characterize relative controllability in time <formula type="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" overflow="scroll"><mi>T</mi></math></formula> in terms of an algebraic property of the matrix-valued coefficients, which reduces to the usual Kalman controllability criterion in the case of a single delay. Relative controllability is studied for solutions in the set of all functions and in the function spaces <formula type="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" overflow="scroll"><msup><mi>L</mi><mi>p</mi></msup></math></formula> and <formula type="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" overflow="scroll"><msup><mi>C</mi><mi>k</mi></msup></math></formula>. We also compare the relative controllability of the system for different delays in terms of their rational dependence structure, proving that relative controllability for some delays implies relative controllability for all delays that are “less rationally dependent" than the original ones. Finally, we provide an upper bound on the minimal controllability time for a system depending only on its dimension and on its largest delay.</p>

          <p noindent="true">In <ref xlink:href="#geco-2016-bid90" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/> we address the stability of transport systems and wave propagation on general networks with time-varying parameters. We do so by reformulating these systems as non-autonomous difference equations and by providing a suitable representation of their solutions in terms of their initial conditions and some time-dependent matrix coefficients. This enables us to characterize the asymptotic behavior of solutions in terms of such coefficients. In the case of difference equations with arbitrary switching, we obtain a delay-independent generalization of the well-known criterion for autonomous systems due to Hale and Silkowski. As a consequence, we show that exponential stability of transport systems and wave propagation on networks is robust with respect to variations of the lengths of the edges of the network preserving their rational dependence structure. This leads to our main result: the wave equation on a network with arbitrarily switching damping at external vertices is exponentially stable if and only if the network is a tree and the damping is bounded away from zero at all external vertices but at most one.</p>
