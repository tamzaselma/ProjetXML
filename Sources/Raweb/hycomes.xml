      <bodyTitle>Hybrid Systems Modeling</bodyTitle>
      <p>Systems industries today make extensive use of mathematical modeling
tools to design computer controlled physical systems. This class of
tools addresses the modeling of physical systems with models that
are simpler than usual scientific computing problems by using only
Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE) and Difference Equations but
not Partial Differential Equations (PDE). This family of tools first
emerged in the 1980's with SystemBuild by MatrixX (now distributed
by National Instruments) followed soon by Simulink by Mathworks,
with an impressive subsequent development.</p>
      <p>In the early 90's control scientists from the University of Lund
(Sweden) realized that the above approach did not support component
based modeling of physical systems with
reuse <footnote id="uid8" id-text="1"><ref xlink:href="http://www.lccc.lth.se/media/LCCC2012/WorkshopSeptember/slides/Astrom.pdf" location="extern" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest">http://<allowbreak/>www.<allowbreak/>lccc.<allowbreak/>lth.<allowbreak/>se/<allowbreak/>media/<allowbreak/>LCCC2012/<allowbreak/>WorkshopSeptember/<allowbreak/>slides/<allowbreak/>Astrom.<allowbreak/>pdf</ref></footnote>.
For instance, it was not easy to draw an electrical or hydraulic
circuit by assembling component models of the various devices. The
development of the Omola language by Hilding Elmqvist was a first
attempt to bridge this gap by supporting some form of Differential
Algebraic Equations (DAE) in the models. Modelica quickly emerged
from this first attempt and became in the 2000's a major
international concerted effort with the Modelica Consortium
<footnote id="uid9" id-text="2"><ref xlink:href="https://www.modelica.org/" location="extern" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest">https://<allowbreak/>www.<allowbreak/>modelica.<allowbreak/>org/</ref></footnote>. A wider set of tools,
both industrial and academic, now exists in this segment
<footnote id="uid10" id-text="3">SimScape by Mathworks, Amesim by LMS International, now
Siemens PLM, and more.</footnote>. In the EDA sector, VHDL-AMS was developed
as a standard  <ref xlink:href="#hycomes-2016-bid0" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>.</p>
      <p>Despite these tools are now widely used by a number of engineers,
they raise a number of technical difficulties. The meaning of some
programs, their mathematical semantics, can be tainted with
uncertainty. A main source of difficulty lies in the failure to
properly handle the discrete and the continuous parts of systems,
and their interaction. How the propagation of mode changes and
resets should be handled? How to avoid artifacts due to the use of a
global ODE solver causing unwanted coupling between seemingly non
interacting subsystems? Also, the mixed use of an equational style
for the continuous dynamics with an imperative style for the mode
changes and resets is a source of difficulty when handling parallel
composition. It is therefore not uncommon that tools return complex
warnings for programs with many different suggested hints for fixing
them. Yet, these “pathological” programs can still be executed, if
wanted so, giving surprising results — See for instance the
Simulink examples in  <ref xlink:href="#hycomes-2016-bid1" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>,
<ref xlink:href="#hycomes-2016-bid2" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>
and  <ref xlink:href="#hycomes-2016-bid3" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>.</p>
      <p>Indeed this area suffers from the same difficulties that led to the
development of the theory of synchronous languages as an effort to
fix obscure compilation schemes for discrete time equation based
languages in the 1980's. Our vision is that hybrid systems modeling
tools deserve similar efforts in theory as synchronous languages did
for the programming of embedded systems.</p>

      <bodyTitle>Background on non-standard analysis</bodyTitle>
      <p>Non-Standard analysis plays a central role in our research on hybrid
systems modeling <ref xlink:href="#hycomes-2016-bid2" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>,
<ref xlink:href="#hycomes-2016-bid1" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>, <ref xlink:href="#hycomes-2016-bid4" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>, <ref xlink:href="#hycomes-2016-bid3" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>. The following text provides a brief
summary of this theory and gives some hints on its usefulness in the
context of hybrid systems modeling. This presentation is based on our
paper <ref xlink:href="#hycomes-2016-bid2" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>, a chapter of Simon
Bliudze's PhD thesis  <ref xlink:href="#hycomes-2016-bid5" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>, and a recent presentation
of non-standard analysis, not axiomatic in style, due to the
mathematician Lindström  <ref xlink:href="#hycomes-2016-bid6" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>.</p>
      <p>Non-standard numbers allowed us to reconsider the semantics of hybrid
systems and propose a radical alternative to the <i>super-dense
time semantics</i> developed by Edward Lee and his team as part of the
Ptolemy II project, where cascades of successive instants can occur in
zero time by using <formula type="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" overflow="scroll"><mrow><msub><mi>ℝ</mi><mo>+</mo></msub><mo>×</mo><mi>ℕ</mi></mrow></math></formula> as a time index. In the non-standard
semantics, the time index is defined as a set
<formula type="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" overflow="scroll"><mrow><mi>𝕋</mi><mo>=</mo><mo>{</mo><mi>n</mi><mi>∂</mi><mo>∣</mo><mi>n</mi><mo>∈</mo><mrow><msup><mrow/><mo>*</mo></msup><mi>ℕ</mi></mrow><mo>}</mo></mrow></math></formula>, where <formula type="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" overflow="scroll"><mi>∂</mi></math></formula> is an
<i>infinitesimal</i> and <formula type="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" overflow="scroll"><mrow><msup><mrow/><mo>*</mo></msup><mi>ℕ</mi></mrow></math></formula> is the set of <i>non-standard
integers</i>. Remark that 1/ <formula type="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" overflow="scroll"><mi>𝕋</mi></math></formula> is dense in <formula type="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" overflow="scroll"><msub><mi>ℝ</mi><mo>+</mo></msub></math></formula>, making it
“continuous”, and 2/ every <formula type="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" overflow="scroll"><mrow><mi>t</mi><mo>∈</mo><mi>𝕋</mi></mrow></math></formula> has a predecessor in <formula type="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" overflow="scroll"><mi>𝕋</mi></math></formula> and a
successor in <formula type="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" overflow="scroll"><mi>𝕋</mi></math></formula>, making it “discrete”. Although it is not effective from
a computability point of view, the <i>non-standard semantics</i>
provides a framework that is familiar to the computer
scientist and at the same time efficient as a symbolic
abstraction. This makes it an excellent candidate for the development
of provably correct compilation schemes and type systems for hybrid
systems modeling languages.</p>
      <p>Non-standard analysis was proposed by Abraham Robinson in the
1960s to allow the explicit manipulation of “infinitesimals” in
analysis  <ref xlink:href="#hycomes-2016-bid7" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>, <ref xlink:href="#hycomes-2016-bid8" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>, <ref xlink:href="#hycomes-2016-bid9" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>.
Robinson's approach is axiomatic; he proposes adding three new axioms to the
basic Zermelo-Fraenkel (ZFC) framework.
There has been much debate in the mathematical community as to
whether it is worth considering non-standard analysis instead of
staying with the traditional one.
We do not enter this debate.
The important thing for us is that non-standard analysis allows the use of
the non-standard discretization of continuous dynamics “as if” it was
operational.</p>
      <p>Not surprisingly, such an idea is quite ancient. Iwasaki et
al.  <ref xlink:href="#hycomes-2016-bid10" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/> first proposed using non-standard
analysis to discuss the nature of time in hybrid systems. Bliudze and
Krob  <ref xlink:href="#hycomes-2016-bid11" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>, <ref xlink:href="#hycomes-2016-bid5" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/> have also used non-standard
analysis as a mathematical support for defining a system theory for
hybrid systems. They discuss in detail the notion of “system” and
investigate computability issues. The formalization they propose
closely follows that of Turing machines, with a memory tape and a
control mechanism.</p>
      <p>The introduction to non-standard analysis in  <ref xlink:href="#hycomes-2016-bid5" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/> is very
pleasant and we take the liberty to borrow it. This presentation was
originally due to Lindstrøm, see  <ref xlink:href="#hycomes-2016-bid6" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>. Its interest is that it
does not require any fancy axiomatic material but only makes use of
the axiom of choice — actually a weaker form of it. The proposed
construction bears some resemblance to the construction of <formula type="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" overflow="scroll"><mi>ℝ</mi></math></formula> as
the set of equivalence classes of Cauchy sequences in <formula type="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" overflow="scroll"><mi>ℚ</mi></math></formula> modulo the
equivalence relation <formula type="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" overflow="scroll"><mrow><mrow><mo>(</mo><msub><mi>u</mi><mi>n</mi></msub><mo>)</mo></mrow><mo>≈</mo><mrow><mo>(</mo><msub><mi>v</mi><mi>n</mi></msub><mo>)</mo></mrow></mrow></math></formula> iff

      <bodyTitle>Contract-Based Design, Interfaces Theories, and Requirements Engineering</bodyTitle>
      <p>System companies such as automotive and aeronautic companies are
facing significant difficulties due to the exponentially raising
complexity of their products coupled with increasingly tight demands
on functionality, correctness, and time-to-market. The cost of being
late to market or of imperfections in the products is staggering as
witnessed by the recent recalls and delivery delays that many major
car and airplane manufacturers had to bear in the recent years. The
specific root causes of these design problems are complex and relate
to a number of issues ranging from design processes and
relationships with different departments of the same company and
with suppliers, to incomplete requirement specification and testing.</p>
      <p>We believe the most promising means to address the challenges in
systems engineering is to employ structured and formal design
methodologies that seamlessly and coherently combine the various
viewpoints of the design space (behavior, space, time, energy,
reliability, ...), that provide the appropriate abstractions to
manage the inherent complexity, and that can provide
correct-by-construction implementations. The following technology
issues must be addressed when developing new approaches to the
design of complex systems:</p>
      <simplelist>
        <li id="uid13">
          <p noindent="true">The overall design flows for heterogeneous systems and the
associated use of models across traditional boundaries are not well
developed and understood. Relationships between different teams
inside a same company, or between different stake-holders in the
supplier chain, are not well supported by solid technical
descriptions for the mutual obligations.</p>
        </li>
        <li id="uid14">
          <p noindent="true">System requirements capture and analysis is in large part a
heuristic process, where the informal text and natural
language-based techniques in use today are facing significant
challenges. Formal requirements engineering is in its infancy:
mathematical models, formal analysis techniques and links to system
implementation must be developed.</p>
        </li>
        <li id="uid15">
          <p noindent="true">Dealing with variability, uncertainty, and life-cycle issues,
such as extensibility of a product family, are not well-addressed
using available systems engineering methodologies and tools.</p>
        </li>
      </simplelist>
      <p>The challenge is to address the entire process and not to consider
only local solutions of methodology, tools, and models that ease part
of the design.</p>
      <p><i>Contract-based design</i> has been proposed as a new approach to
the system design problem that is rigorous and effective in dealing
with the problems and challenges described before, and that, at the
same time, does not require a radical change in the way industrial
designers carry out their task as it cuts across design flows of
different type.
Indeed, contracts can be used almost everywhere and at nearly all
stages of system design, from early requirements capture, to embedded
computing infrastructure and detailed design involving circuits and
other hardware. Contracts explicitly handle pairs of properties,
respectively representing the assumptions on the environment and the
guarantees of the system under these assumptions. Intuitively, a
contract is a pair <formula type="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" overflow="scroll"><mrow><mi>C</mi><mo>=</mo><mo>(</mo><mi>A</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>G</mi><mo>)</mo></mrow></math></formula> of assumptions and guarantees
characterizing in a formal way 1) under which context the design is
assumed to operate, and 2) what its obligations are. Assume/Guarantee
reasoning has been known for a long time, and has been used mostly as
verification mean for the design of
software  <ref xlink:href="#hycomes-2016-bid12" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>. However, contract based
design with explicit assumptions is a philosophy that should be
followed all along the design, with all kinds of models, whenever
necessary. Here, specifications are not limited to profiles, types, or
taxonomy of data, but also describe the functions, performances of
various kinds (time and energy), and reliability.
This amounts to enrich a component's interface with, on one hand, formal
specifications of the behavior of the environment in which the component may
be instantiated and, on the other hand, of the expected behavior of the component itself.
The consideration of rich interfaces is still in its infancy. So far,
academic researchers have addressed the mathematics and algorithmics
of interfaces theories and contract-based reasoning. To make them a
technique of choice for system engineers, we must develop:</p>
      <simplelist>
        <li id="uid16">
          <p noindent="true">Mathematical foundations for interfaces and requirements
engineering that enable the design of frameworks and tools;</p>
        </li>
        <li id="uid17">
          <p noindent="true">A system engineering framework and associated methodologies and tool
sets that focus on system requirements modeling, contract specification,
and verification at multiple abstraction layers.</p>
        </li>
      </simplelist>
      <p>A detailed bibliography on contract and interface theories for
embedded system design can be found
in <ref xlink:href="#hycomes-2016-bid13" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>. In a nutshell, contract and
interface theories fall into two main categories:</p>
      <descriptionlist>
        <label>Assume/guarantee contracts.</label>
        <li id="uid18">
          <p noindent="true">By explicitly relying on the
notions of assumptions and guarantees, A/G-contracts are intuitive,
which makes them appealing for the engineer. In A/G-contracts,
assumptions and guarantees are just properties regarding the
behavior of a component and of its environment. The typical case is
when these properties are formal languages or sets of traces, which
includes the class of safety
properties  <ref xlink:href="#hycomes-2016-bid14" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>, <ref xlink:href="#hycomes-2016-bid15" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>, <ref xlink:href="#hycomes-2016-bid16" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>, <ref xlink:href="#hycomes-2016-bid17" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>, <ref xlink:href="#hycomes-2016-bid18" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>. Contract
theories were initially developed as specification formalisms able
to refuse some inputs from the
environment  <ref xlink:href="#hycomes-2016-bid19" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>. A/G-contracts were advocated
by the <span class="smallcap" align="left">Speeds</span> project  <ref xlink:href="#hycomes-2016-bid20" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>. They
were further experimented in the framework of the CESAR
project  <ref xlink:href="#hycomes-2016-bid21" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>, with the additional consideration of
<i>weak</i> and <i>strong</i> assumptions. This is still a very
active research topic, with several recent contributions dealing
with the timed  <ref xlink:href="#hycomes-2016-bid22" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/> and

focus primarily on parallel composition and compatibility: Two
interfaces can be composed and are compatible if there is at least
one environment where they can work together. The idea is that the
resulting composition exposes as an interface the needed information
to ensure that incompatible pairs of states cannot be reached. This
can be achieved by using the possibility, for an Interface
Automaton, to refuse selected inputs from the environment in a given
state, which amounts to the implicit assumption that the environment
will never produce any of the refused inputs, when the interface is
in this state. Modal

Interfaces are strictly more expressive than Interface Automata by
decoupling the I/O orientation of an event and its deontic

      <p>Requirements Engineering is one of the major concerns in large systems
industries today, particularly so in sectors where certification
prevails  <ref xlink:href="#hycomes-2016-bid45" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>. DOORS projects collecting
requirements are poorly structured and cannot be considered a formal
modeling framework today. They are nothing more than an informal
documentation enriched with hyperlinks. As examples, medium size
sub-systems may have a few thousands requirements and the Rafale
fighter aircraft has above 250,000 of them. For the Boeing 787,
requirements were not stable while subcontractors performed the
development of the fly-by-wire and of the landing gear subsystems.</p>
      <p>We see Contract-Based Design and Interfaces Theories as innovative
tools in support of Requirements Engineering. The Software
Engineering community has extensively covered several aspects of
Requirements Engineering, in particular:</p>
      <simplelist>
        <li id="uid20">
          <p noindent="true">the development and use of large and rich <i>ontologies</i>; and</p>

structural aspects of requirements and resulting hyperlinks (to
tests, documentation, PLM, architecture, and so on).</p>
        </li>
      </simplelist>
      <p>Behavioral models and properties, however, are not properly
encompassed by the above approaches. This is the cause of a remaining
gap between this phase of systems design and later phases where formal
model based methods involving behavior have become prevalent—see the
success of Matlab/Simulink/Scade technologies. We believe that our
work on contract based design and interface theories is best suited to

      <bodyTitle>Cyber-Physical Systems Design</bodyTitle>
      <p>Academic research and industry are currently witnessing several
major revolutions: <i>Cyber-Physical Systems</i> (CPS),
<i>Big-Data</i> and <i>Cloud Computing</i>, just to name a few. The
Hycomes team is focused on CPS, and more precisely on CPS modeling
with two targeted applications: The rigorous design of CPS and the
optimal exploitation of CPS. Despite many
engineers believe that <i>systems become too complex to be modeled
in a faithfully</i>, the Hycomes team defends the opposite idea. We believe
in the benefits of modeling, but acknowledge that the communities of
researchers and tool developers are in part responsible for this
defiance. The steep increase in the complexity of systems (e.g., public transportation systems, electric power grids) and of their
models comes from composing smaller subsystems into complex
architectures. As a matter of fact, these architectures are sparse,
and subsystems interactions are confined to immediate surrounding
neighborhoods. Thus, the dimension (number of state variables) of a
system is not the most appropriate characterization of its
complexity. It is rather the structure of a system and its
combinatorics of modes of operation that encapsulate its complexity.</p>
      <p>The main objective of the Hycomes team is to advance modeling technologies
(languages, compile-time analyses, simulation techniques) for CPS
combining physical interactions, communication layers and software components.
We believe that mastering CPS comprising thousands to millions of components requires
radical changes of paradigms. For instance, modeling techniques must
be revised, especially when physics is involved. Modeling languages
must be enhanced to cope with larger models. This can only be
done by combining new <b>compilation</b> techniques (to master the
structural complexity of models) with new <b>mathematical</b> tools
(new numerical methods, in particular).
We identify below the different axis we want to tackle.</p>
      <subsection id="uid24" level="2">
        <bodyTitle>Modelica</bodyTitle>
        <p>Modelica is a component-based modeling language initially designed for
the modeling of multi-physics systems. The
mathematical paradigm underlying Modelica, known as <i>Differential
Algebraic Equations</i> (DAE). The key challenge is to be
able to combine algebraic constraints, resulting from the laws of
physics, in interaction with the nonsmooth behavior of some physical
phenomena (e.g., impact laws), the multiple modes of operation of the system, and the
intrinsically discrete behavior of software components.
In essence, Modelica is based on the concept of multi-mode DAE, so
that models can switch from one behavior to another when an event occurs,
typically the crossing of a threshold.
This approach is paramount to the modeling of large CPS.
For instance, EDF has done a thorough modeling of the electric power
grid of the Reunion island <footnote id="uid25" id-text="4"><ref xlink:href="http://www.ceser-reunion.fr/fileadmin/user_upload/tx_pubdb/archives/10.10.18_Rapport_electricite.pdf" location="extern" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest">http://<allowbreak/>www.<allowbreak/>ceser-reunion.<allowbreak/>fr/<allowbreak/>fileadmin/<allowbreak/>user_upload/<allowbreak/>tx_pubdb/<allowbreak/>archives/<allowbreak/>10.<allowbreak/>10.<allowbreak/>18_Rapport_electricite.<allowbreak/>pdf</ref></footnote>. This
was undertaken to gain a better understanding of this complex and
notably unstable assembly of highly decentralized electric power
plants: dams, small thermal power plants, wind and solar farms, and
residential solar panels, just to name a few.
This large model turned out to be intractable with state-of-the-art
Modelica tools: because Modelica compilation techniques are not
modular, the whole model has to be compiled as one unit, resulting in
a very large simulation code. Parallel simulation of Modelica models
is still in its infancy and gives poor results on very large models  <ref xlink:href="#hycomes-2016-bid46" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>;
parallel/distributed techniques for networks of FMU components are not
applicable to a monolithic model  <ref xlink:href="#hycomes-2016-bid47" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>, <ref xlink:href="#hycomes-2016-bid48" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>.
Moreover, when simulating, for instance, thermal models of a
building, the opening of a window or of a door impacts the whole
simulation, despite it only has a local impact on the heat exchanges
and temperatures. This is caused by the sudden change of stiffness in
some part of the model, that forces a change in discretization step
size (assuming that a variable step solver is used for simulation),
with the adverse effect that the simulation of the whole system is
slowed down.
The root cause of this phenomenon boils down to the fact that system
models and numerical methods used to simulate them are not space
adaptive — recall that such models are 0-D models, with ODEs/DAEs,
with no Partial Differential Equations (PDEs).</p>

co-modeling and co-simulation has contributed to the widespread belief
that the co-simulation of a large number of models is achievable using
FMI-based tools. This is unfortunately an illusion, as FMI does not
guarantee the reproducibility and determinacy of simulations. There
are several reasons for that. First, FMI offers no rollback
mechanism  <ref xlink:href="#hycomes-2016-bid49" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>, which makes the
co-simulation to depend on the discretization policy. Second, as the

        <bodyTitle>Beyond simulation</bodyTitle>
        <p>Many physical science engineers (mechanical, electrical, aeronautic,
...) develop models with the sole objective to simulate them, while it
is known that models can be used for a variety of tasks, all
contributing towards the safe design and operation of a CPS:
validating a design model against a set of requirements, assess the
robustness of a model, test implementations against a design model,
perform state estimation during system operation, just to name a few.</p>
        <p>Early stages of CPS design usually consist in the elicitation of
system-level requirements that will be used later on to design
detailed models that can be simulated. Most often, the design tasks
are split among several suppliers. This calls for precise requirements
to be passed to them, so that, as far as feasible, suppliers can work
independently. Some of the requirements specify the allowed behavior
of the sub-system to be design, while others specify the assumed
behavior of the sub-system's environment.</p>
        <p>During operation of a CPS, maintenance tasks play an ever-increasing
role, to minimize the downtime of the system and, to maintain an
extremely low probability of occurrence of catastrophic
failures. <i>Diagnosis</i> enables to replace some routine inspections
or precautionary replacements of critical parts (that are usually
triggered by the number of hours of operation, or by calendar) by
fewer maintenance operations, triggered by the estimated wear or aging
of those parts. This helps to reduce immobilization times and
maintenance costs.
Design models could be reused to help the development of diagnosis
software that will trigger maintenance operations, based on the output
of <i>parity check</i> algorithms  <ref xlink:href="#hycomes-2016-bid50" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>, capable of detecting slow or sudden
changes of some parameters. Reusing design models in this context
would be a genuine innovation, in comparison to the established
practice, where diagnosis is designed by hand, from scratch.</p>

        <p>Because of severe complexity or undecidability problems, CPS formal
verification can be done only on partial and simplified models. When
applicable, these techniques complement usefully simulations. Despite
of the high level of expertise it requires, formal verification brings
a level of confidence in the analyses that can not be compared with
what can be obtained by simulation. Using formal verification makes
sense only for the most critical parts of a CPS. A fine example is the

Test and Flip nets can express causality and conflict relations. The tool takes as input either standard XES log files (a standard XML file format for process mining tools) or a specific XML file format for surgical applications.

      <bodyTitle>Structural Analysis of Multi-Mode DAEs</bodyTitle>
      <p>Differential Algebraic Equation (DAE) systems constitute the
mathematical model supporting physical modeling languages such as
Modelica or Simscape. Unlike Ordinary Differential Equations, or
ODEs, they exhibit subtle issues because of their implicit
<i>latent equations</i> and related <i>differentiation index</i>.
Multi-mode DAE (mDAE) systems are much harder to deal with, not only
because of their mode-dependent dynamics, but essentially because of
the events and resets occurring at mode transitions. Unfortunately,
the large literature devoted to the numerical analysis of DAEs do
not cover the multi-mode case. It typically says nothing about mode
changes. This lack of foundations cause numerous difficulties to
the existing modeling tools. Some models are well handled, others
are not, with no clear boundary between the two classes.
In <ref xlink:href="#hycomes-2016-bid53" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>, we develop a comprehensive
mathematical approach to the <i>structural analysis</i> of mDAE
systems which properly extends the usual analysis of DAE systems. We
define a constructive semantics based on nonstandard analysis and
show how to produce execution schemes in a systematic way. This work
has been accepted for presentation at the HSCC 2017

      <p>In <ref xlink:href="#hycomes-2016-bid54" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>, we investigated decoupling abstractions, by which
we seek to simulate (i.e. abstract) a given system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs)
by another system that features completely independent (i.e. uncoupled) sub-systems, which
can be considered as separate systems in their own right. Beyond a purely mathematical interest as a tool for the
qualitative analysis of ODEs, decoupling can be applied to verification problems arising in the fields of control and hybrid systems.
Existing verification technology often scales poorly with dimension. Thus, reducing a verification
problem to a number of independent verification problems for systems of smaller dimension may enable one to prove
properties that are otherwise seen as too difficult. We show an interesting correspondence between
Darboux polynomials and decoupling simulating abstractions of systems of
polynomial ODEs and give a constructive procedure for automatically computing the
latter.

proving techniques. We consider subsequent advisories and show how to adapt our formal verification to take them into account.
We examine the current version of the real ACAS X system and discuss some cases
where our safety theorem conflicts with the actual advisory given by that
version, demonstrating how formal hybrid systems proving approaches are helping to ensure the
safety of ACAS X. Our approach is general and could also be used to identify unsafe
advice issued by other collision avoidance systems or confirm their safety.

      <bodyTitle>Chattering-Free Simulation</bodyTitle>
      <p>Chattering is a fundamental phenomenon that is unique to hybrid systems, due to the complex interaction
between discrete dynamics (in the form of discrete transitions) and continuous dynamics (in the form of time).
In practice, simulating chattering hybrid systems is challenging in that simulation effectively halts near the
chattering time point, as an infinite number of discrete transitions would need to be simulated.
In <ref xlink:href="#hycomes-2016-bid55" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>, formal conditions are provided for when the
simulated models of hybrid systems display chattering behavior, and methods are proposed for avoiding chattering "on the fly" in runtime.
We utilize dynamical behavior analysis to derive conditions for detecting chattering without enumeration of modes.
We also present a new iterative algorithm to allow for solutions to be carried past the chattering point, and we
show by a prototypical implementation how to generate the equivalent chattering-free dynamics internally by the
simulator in the main simulation loop.

            <p noindent="true">Abstract: Modelling and simulation are efficient and widely used
tools for system design. But they are seldom used for systems
operation. However, most functionalities for system design are
beneficial for system operation, provided that they are enhanced to
deal with real operating situations. Through open standards the
benefits of sharing compatible information and data become obvious:
improved cooperation between the design and the operation
communities, easier adaptation of operation procedures wrt. design
evolutions. Open standards also foster general purpose
technology. The objective of the ITEA 2 MODRIO project is to extend
modelling and simulation tools based on open standards from system
design to system operation.</p>
