      <bodyTitle>Overall Objectives</bodyTitle>
      <glosslist>
        <label>Singularity exponent</label>
        <li>
          <p>A measure of the unpredictability around a point in a complex signal. Based on local reconstruction around a point, singularity exponents can be evaluated in different ways and in different contexts (e.g. non-localized, through the consideration of moments and structure fonctions, trough the computation of singularity spectra). In GEOSTAT we study approaches corresponding to <i>far from equilibrium</i> hypothesis (e.g. microcanonical) leading to geometrically localized singularity exponents.</p>
        </li>
        <label>Singularity spectrum</label>
        <li>
          <p>The mapping from scaling exponents to Hausdorff dimensions. The singularity spectrum quantifies the degree of nonlinearity in a signal or process, and is used to characterize globally the complexity of a signal.</p>
        </li>
        <label>Most Singular Manifold</label>
        <li>
          <p>The set of most unpredictable points in a signal, identified to the set of strongest transitions as defined by the singularity exponents. From that set the whole signal can be reconstructed.</p>
        </li>
        <label>Fully Developed Turbulence (FDT)</label>
        <li>
          <p>Turbulence at very high Reynolds numbers; systems in FDT are beyond deterministic chaos, and symmetries are restored in a statistical sense only.</p>
        </li>
        <label>Compact Representation</label>
        <li>
          <p>Reduced representation of a complex signal (dimensionality reduction) from which the whole signal can be reconstructed. The reduced representation can correspond to points randomly chosen, such as in Compressive Sensing, or to geometric localization related to statistical information content (framework of reconstructible systems).</p>
        </li>
        <label>Sparse representation</label>
        <li>
          <p>The representation of a signal as a linear combination of elements taken in a dictionary (frame or basis), with the aim of finding as less as possible non-zerio coefficients for a large class of signals.</p>
        </li>
        <label>Universality class</label>
        <li>
          <p>In theoretical physics, the observation of the coincidence of the critical exponents (behaviour near a second order phase transition) in different phenomena and systems is called universality. Universality is explained by the theory of the renormalization group, allowing for determination of the changes a physical system undergoes under different distance scales. As a consequence, different macroscopic phenomena displaying a multiscale structure (and their acquisition in the form of complex signals) can be grouped into different sets of universality classes.</p>
        </li>
      </glosslist>
      <p>Every signal conveys, as a measure experiment, information on the physical system whose signal is an acquisition. As a consequence, it seems therefore natural that signal analysis or compression makes use of physical modelling of phenomena: the goal is to find new methodologies in signal processing that goes beyond the simple problem of interpretation. Physics of disordonned systems, and specifically physics of spin glasses is putting forward new algorithmic resolution methods in various domains such as optimization, compressive sensing etc. with significant success notably for NP hard problems.</p>
      <p>Physics of turbulence also introduces phenomelogical approaches based on singularity exponents. Energy cascades are indeed closely related to singular geometrical sets defined randomly. At these structures' scales, information of the process is lost by dissipation. However, all the cascade is encoded in the singular sets. How do these structures organize in space and time, in other words, how do the entropy cascade itself ? To unify these two notions, a description in term of free energy of a generic physical model is possible, such as an elastic interface model in a random nonlinear energy landscape: this is for instance the correspondance between compressible stochastic Burgers equation and directed polymers in a disordonned medium. Typical of such systems, dekrieging transition indicates that each singularity can be understood as a transition between two metastable states. Each of these transitions marks large fluctuations of the system which visits randomly the minima of the free energy. A signal which is an acquisition of such systems displays statistical properties characteristic of different classes, and the nature of noise is determinant. In particular, the dynamics enters a so-called Griffiths phase if for example noise gets structured like a hierarchical network, connected on long range distances, locally recursive, and randomly sparse. In such a context, phenomenologies related to cascades and multi-affine intermittence are present. As a typical example, in the study of cardiac dynamics (a subject that gets interest among statistical physicists) an effective model belonging to a similar category can be contemplated. In such model, an explicitely broken symetry is restaured spontaneously. This is a consequence from the existence of an abelian symetry of topological solutions, where these topological solutions are fronts excited by limiting conditions. A statistical jauge is the signature of a nonlinear intrinsic disorder which emerges for certain regions of parameter space. Such areas have a <i>vitrous</i> nature (Griffiths). The jauge is responsible for jumps between different metastable states and allows to recover singularity exponents of acquired signals. Conversely, the exploration of the phase space in such models can lead to a possible "testing" of the measured system through the computation of singularity exponents and the determination of the nature of intrinsic noise. From these considerations and in a heuristical framework, one sees that the recovering of a <i>semantics</i> in a measured signal can be contemplated.</p>
      <p>GEOSTAT is a research project in <b>nonlinear signal processing</b> which develops on these considerations: it considers the signals as the realizations of complex dynamic systems. The driving approach is to understand the relations between complexity (or information content) and the geometric organization of information in a signal. For instance, for signals which are acquisitions of turbulent fluids, the organization of information is related to the effective presence of a multiscale hierarchy, of multifractal nature, which is strongly related to intermittency and multiplicative cascade phenomena; the determination of this geometric organization unlocks key nonlinear parameters and features associated to these signals; it helps understanding their dynamical properties and, as a consequence, their analysis. We use this approach to derive novel solution methods for <b>super-resolution</b> and data fusion in Universe Sciences acquisitions <ref xlink:href="#geostat-2016-bid0" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>. Another example can be found heartbeat signal analysis, where singularity exponents help understand the distribution of activation points in a signal during episodes of atrial fibrilation. Specific advances are obtained in GEOSTAT in using this type of statistical/geometric approach to get validated dynamical information of signals acquired in Universe Sciences, e.g. Oceanography or Astronomy. The research in GEOSTAT encompasses nonlinear signal processing and the study of emergence in complex systems, with a strong emphasis on geometric approaches to complexity. Consequently, research in GEOSTAT is oriented towards the determination, in real signals, of quantities or phenomena, usually unattainable through linear methods, that are known to play an important role both in the evolution of dynamical systems whose acquisitions are the signals under study, and in the compact representations of the signals themselves. Research in GEOSTAT is structured in two parts:</p>

Presently GEOSTAT explores new methods for analyzing and understanding complex signals in different applicative domains <ref xlink:href="#geostat-2016-bid12" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>. Derived from ideas in Statistical Physics, the methods developed in GEOSTAT provide new ways to relate and evaluate quantitatively the <i>local irregularity</i> in complex signals and systems, the statistical concepts of <i>information content</i> and <i>most informative subset</i>. As a result, GEOSTAT is aimed at providing <i>radically new approaches</i> to the study of signals acquired from different complex systems (their analysis, their classification, the study of their dynamical properties etc.). A common characteristic of these signals, which is related to <i>universality classes</i> <ref xlink:href="#geostat-2016-bid13" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/> <ref xlink:href="#geostat-2016-bid14" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/> <ref xlink:href="#geostat-2016-bid15" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>, being the existence of a <i>multiscale organization</i> of the systems. For instance, the classical notion of <i>edge</i> or <i>border</i>, which is of multiscale nature, and whose importance is well known in Computer Vision and Image Processing, receives profound and rigorous new definitions, in relation with the more physical notion of <i>transition</i> and fits adequately to the case of chaotic data. The description is analogous to the modeling of states far from equilibrium, that is to say, there is no stationarity assumption. From this formalism we derive methods able to determine geometrically the most informative part in a signal, which also defines its global properties and allows for <i>compact representation</i> in the wake of known problematics addressed, for instance, in <i>time-frequency analysis</i>. It appears that the notion of <i>transition front</i> in a signal is much more complex than previously expected and, most importantly, related to multiscale notions encountered in the study of nonlinearity <ref xlink:href="#geostat-2016-bid16" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>. For instance, we give new insights to the computation of dynamical properties in complex signals, in particular in signals for which the classical tools for analyzing dynamics give poor results (such as, for example, correlation methods or optical flow for determining motion in turbulent datasets).

      <bodyTitle>Multiscale description in terms of multiplicative cascade</bodyTitle>
      <p>GEOSTAT is studying complex signals under the point of view of methods developed in <i>statistical physics</i> to study complex systems, with a strong emphasis on multiresolution analysis. Linear methods in signal processing refer to the standard point of view under which operators are expressed by simple convolutions with impulse responses. Linear methods in signal processing are widely used, from least-square deconvolution methods in adaptive optics to source-filter models in speech processing. Because of the absence of localization of the Fourier transform, linear methods are not successful to unlock the multiscale structures and cascading properties of variables which are of primary importance as stated by the physics of the phenomena. This is the reason why new approaches, such as DFA (Detrented Fluctuation Analysis), Time-frequency analysis, variations on curvelets  <ref xlink:href="#geostat-2016-bid17" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/> etc. have appeared during the last decades. Recent advances in dimensionality reduction, and notably in Compressive Sensing, go beyond the Nyquist rate in sampling theory using nonlinear reconstruction, but data reduction occur at random places, independently of geometric localization of information content, which can be very useful for acquisition purposes, but of lower impact in signal analysis. One important result obtained in GEOSTAT is the effective use of multiresolution analysis associated to optimal inference along the scales of a complex system. The multiresolution analysis is performed on dimensionless quantities given by the <i>singularity exponents</i> which encode properly the geometrical structures associated to multiscale organization. This is applied successfully in the derivation of high resolution ocean dynamics, or the high resolution mapping of gaseous exchanges between the ocean and the atmosphere; the latter is of primary importance for a quantitative evaluation of global warming. Understanding the dynamics of complex systems is recognized as a new discipline, which makes use of theoretical and methodological foundations coming from nonlinear physics, the study of dynamical systems and many aspects of computer science. One of the challenges is related to the question of <i>emergence</i> in complex systems: large-scale effects measurable macroscopically from a system made of huge numbers of interactive agents <ref xlink:href="#geostat-2016-bid18" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>, <ref xlink:href="#geostat-2016-bid19" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>, <ref xlink:href="#geostat-2016-bid20" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>, <ref xlink:href="#geostat-2016-bid21" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>. Some quantities related to nonlinearity, such as Lyapunov exponents, Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy etc. can be computed at least in the phase space  <ref xlink:href="#geostat-2016-bid10" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>. Consequently, knowledge from acquisitions of complex systems (which include <i>complex signals</i>) could be obtained from information about the phase space. A result from F. Takens  <ref xlink:href="#geostat-2016-bid8" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/> about strange attractors in turbulence has motivated the determination of discrete dynamical systems associated to time series  <ref xlink:href="#geostat-2016-bid9" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>, and consequently the theoretical determination of nonlinear characteristics associated to complex acquisitions. Emergence phenomena can also be traced inside complex signals themselves, by trying to localize information content geometrically. Fundamentally, in the nonlinear analysis of complex signals there are broadly two approaches: characterization by attractors (embedding and bifurcation) and time-frequency, multiscale/multiresolution approaches. Time-frequency analysis  <ref xlink:href="#geostat-2016-bid22" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/> and multiscale/multiresolution are the subjects of intense research and are profoundly reshaping the analysis of complex signals by nonlinear approaches  <ref xlink:href="#geostat-2016-bid23" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>, <ref xlink:href="#geostat-2016-bid24" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>.
In real situations, the phase space associated to the acquisition of a complex phenomenon is unknown. It is however possible to relate, inside the signal's domain, local predictability to local reconstruction and deduce from that singularity exponents <ref xlink:href="#geostat-2016-bid3" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>   <ref xlink:href="#geostat-2016-bid2" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>. We are working on:</p>
      <simplelist>
        <li id="uid10">
          <p noindent="true">the determination of quantities related to universality classses,</p>
        </li>
        <li id="uid11">
          <p noindent="true">the geometric localization of multiscale properties in complex signals,</p>
        </li>
        <li id="uid12">
          <p noindent="true">cascading characteristics of physical variables.</p>
        </li>
      </simplelist>
      <p>The alternative approach taken in GEOSTAT is microscopical, or geometrical: the multiscale structures which have their "fingerprint" in complex signals are being isolated in a single realization of the complex system, i.e. using the data of the signal itself, as opposed to the consideration of grand ensembles or a wide set of realizations. This is much harder than the ergodic approaches, but it is possible because a reconstruction formula such as the one derived in  <ref xlink:href="#geostat-2016-bid12" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/> is local and reconstruction in the signal's domain is related to predictability. This approach is analogous to the consideration of "microcanonical ensembles" in statistical mechanics.</p>
      <p>A multiscale organization is a fundamental feature of a complex system, it can be for example related to the cascading properties in turbulent systems. We make use of this kind of description when analyzing turbulent signals: intermittency is observed within the inertial range and is related to the fact that, in the case of FDT, symmetry is restored only in a statistical sense, a fact that has consequences on the quality of any nonlinear signal representation by frames or dictionaries.</p>
      <p>The example of FDT as a standard "template" for developing general methods that apply to a vast class of complex systems and signals is of fundamental interest because, in FDT, the existence of a multiscale hierarchy <formula type="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" overflow="scroll"><msub><mi>ℱ</mi><mi>h</mi></msub></math></formula> which is of multifractal nature and geometrically localized can be derived from physical considerations. This geometric hierarchy of sets is responsible for the shape of the computed singularity spectra, which in turn is related to the statistical organization of information content in a signal. It explains scale invariance, a characteristic feature of complex signals. The analogy from statistical physics comes from the fact that singularity exponents are direct generalizations of <i>critical exponents</i> which explain the macroscopic properties of a system around critical points, and the quantitative characterization of <i>universality classes</i>, which allow the definition of methods and algorithms that apply to general complex signals and systems, and not only turbulent signals: signals which belong to a same universality class share common statistical organization. In GEOSTAT, the approach to singularity exponents is done within a microcanonical setting, which can interestingly be compared with other approaches such that wavelet leaders, WTMM or DFA. During the past decades, classical approaches (here called "canonical" because they use the analogy taken from the consideration of "canonical ensembles" in statistical mechanics) permitted the development of a well-established analogy taken from thermodynamics in the analysis of complex signals: if <formula type="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" overflow="scroll"><mi>ℱ</mi></math></formula> is the free energy, <formula type="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" overflow="scroll"><mi>𝒯</mi></math></formula> the temperature measured in energy units, <formula type="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" overflow="scroll"><mi>𝒰</mi></math></formula> the internal energy per volume unit <formula type="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" overflow="scroll"><mi>𝒮</mi></math></formula> the entropy and <formula type="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" overflow="scroll"><mrow><mover accent="true"><mi>β</mi><mo>^</mo></mover><mo>=</mo><mn>1</mn><mo>/</mo><mi>𝒯</mi></mrow></math></formula>, then the scaling exponents associated to moments of intensive variables <formula type="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" overflow="scroll"><mrow><mi>p</mi><mo>→</mo><msub><mi>τ</mi><mi>p</mi></msub></mrow></math></formula> corresponds to <formula type="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" overflow="scroll"><mrow><mover accent="true"><mi>β</mi><mo>^</mo></mover><mi>ℱ</mi></mrow></math></formula>, <formula type="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" overflow="scroll"><mrow><mi>𝒰</mi><mo>(</mo><mover accent="true"><mi>β</mi><mo>^</mo></mover><mo>)</mo></mrow></math></formula> corresponds to the singularity exponents values, and <formula type="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" overflow="scroll"><mrow><mi>𝒮</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>𝒰</mi><mo>)</mo></mrow></math></formula> to the singularity spectrum.</p>
      <p>The singularity exponents belong to a universality class, independently of microscopic properties in the phase space of various complex systems, and beyond the particular case of turbulent data (where the existence of a multiscale hierarchy, of multifractal nature, can be inferred directly from physical considerations). They describe common multiscale statistical organizations in different complex systems  <ref xlink:href="#geostat-2016-bid16" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>, and this is why GEOSTAT is working on nonlinear signal processing tools that are applied to very different types of signals.</p>
      <p>For example we give some insight about the collaboration with LEGOS Dynbio team <footnote id="uid13" id-text="1"><ref xlink:href="http://www.legos.obs-mip.fr/recherches/equipes/dynbio" location="extern" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest">http://<allowbreak/>www.<allowbreak/>legos.<allowbreak/>obs-mip.<allowbreak/>fr/<allowbreak/>recherches/<allowbreak/>equipes/<allowbreak/>dynbio</ref>.</footnote> about high-resolution ocean dynamics from microcanonical formulations in nonlinear complex signal analysis. Indeed, synoptic determination of ocean circulation using data acquired from space, with a coherent depiction of its turbulent characteristics remains a fundamental challenge in oceanography. This determination has the potential of revealing all aspects of the ocean dynamic variability on a wide range of spatio-temporal scales and will enhance our understanding of ocean-atmosphere exchanges at super resolution, as required in the present context of climate change. We show that the determination of a multiresolution analysis associated to the multiplicative cascade of a typical physical variable like the Sea Surface Temperature permits an <i>optimal inference</i> of oceanic motion field across the scales, resulting in a new method for deriving super resolution oceanic motion from lower resolution altimetry data; the resulting oceanic motion field is validated at super resolution with the use of Lagrangian buoy data available from the Global Drifter Program <footnote id="uid14" id-text="2"><ref xlink:href="http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/phod/dac/index.php" location="extern" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest">http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/phod/dac/index.php</ref>.</footnote>.

      <bodyTitle>Excitable systems and heartbeat signal analysis</bodyTitle>
      <p>We are developing novel approaches to heartbeat signal analysis for understanding chronic atrial fibrillation. The noisy aspect of data recorded by electrodes, on the inner surface of human atria during episodes of atrial fibrillation, exhibit intriguing features for excitable media. Instead of phase chaos as typically expected, it shares many common traits of non-equilibrium fluctuations in disordered systems or strong turbulence. To assess those peculiar observations we investigate a <i>synaptic plasticity</i> that affects conduction properties. Electrical synapses comprise many different kinds of connexins, which may be affected by diverse factors, so we use a generic approach. Slight detuning of their linear response leads to an instability of the modulating agents, here an excess charge. Acting on slow time scales of repolarisation, it is understood as <i>collective modes</i> propagating through and retroacting on each synapse: the medium is <i>desynchronised</i>. It is not a syncytium. We propose to associate transient states with a phenomenon called <i>electrical remodelling</i>, which has not received any accepted description thus far. Moreover, from the properties of the model it is possible to start exploring phase space. Transitions between different regimes could help decipher stages in the evolution of the disease from acute to chronic, one main goal of cardiovascular research.</p>
      <p>Theoretically, a myocardium is an excitable tissue acting under normal circumstances as a functional syncytium of myocardial cells. Models of excitability for the heart are reaction-diffusion systems describing the propagation of electric pulses called action potentials similarly to models for axons. Reaction results from ionic exchange cycles between the cytoplasm of excitable cells and their extra-cellular medium, when initiated by a stimulus above some threshold. Pulses are robust topological structures.</p>
      <p>Considering the stable fixed point as a phase resetting state, chaos may arise in spatio-temporal sequences. This is the paradigm for cardiac fibrillation. But, it is incompatible with the following observations: the distributions of amplitudes all collapse on a scaling function <formula type="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" overflow="scroll"><mi>G</mi></math></formula>. We map exponents on data patients provided by IHU LIRYC showing non-universal properties. Singular exponents are observed with consistent Hausdorff dimension of sets <formula type="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" overflow="scroll"><mrow><mi>D</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>h</mi><mo>)</mo></mrow></math></formula>. Negative contribution is high, suggesting an underlying multiplicative process.</p>
      <p>Excess charge in cells like of <i>Ca</i> may perturb the dynamics of synapses. We consider a physiologically plausible linear response of synapses to the electro-chemical potential. This response is unknown as of today. The new dynamics may interact with excitability. It has the specific form of a Rayleigh instability. Cycles become retarded or advanced. Hopf bifurcation and chaos are allowed creating EADs (Early After Depolarization). Regarding propagation, pulses are pinned and released on a chaotic background. Cycle modulations create defects via facilitation through the third dimension. Defects proliferate creating a glassy phase, which back-scatter fronts in 1D and roughens them in 2D. Further effective inhibitor diffusion splits them. Electrical remodelling is here the abnormal modification of the cell dynamics without any membrane alteration.</p>
      <p>There are features of Self Organized Criticality (SOC) in large regions of phase space. Pulses have a phase and propagate on a random medium. For instance one paradigm we investigate would be:</p>

Randomness reactualises non-linearly, which tells that the noise is quenched and reset. For instance in 1 + 1D, spatio-temporal maps look very much like optimal directed paths along diagonals. In 1 + 2D, we are guessing that pulses do propagate in the (q)KPZ universality class, just as the remodelling front does. This class is only fractal, but together with large deviations of the fluctuations, it may be consistent with a multi-affine process. Physiologically, one interesting bonus is the interpretation of non-reentrant Tachycardia as dislocation patterns slowly evolving.

      <p>Our research in speech processing focus on the development of novel nonlinear analysis methods for the characterization and classification of pathological and affective speech. For the latter, classical linear methods do not generally capture the nonlinearity, aperiodicity, turbulence and noise that can be present in pathological voices. We thus aim to design and extract new features that allow better characterization/classification of such voices, while being easy to interpret by clinicians.
For the former, recent research have shown that the voice source signal information allow significant improvement of speech emotion detection systems. Our goal is to develop novel nonlinear techniques to extract relevant voice source features and to design efficient machine learning algorithms for robust emotion classification.

      <bodyTitle>Automatic segmentation of activation periods in an electrogram during atrial fibrillation</bodyTitle>
      <p>Participants: G. Attuel, H. Yahia.</p>
      <p noindent="true">Experiments show that the multiscale properties displayed in signals recording the electrical activity of the heart during (atrial) fibrillation are of the type <i>out of equilibrium dynamics</i>. These dynamics have common features, possibily shared by "subclasses": "<formula type="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" overflow="scroll"><mrow><mn>1</mn><mo>/</mo><mi>f</mi></mrow></math></formula> power spectrum", large proability laws for the distributions of the amplitude increments, multifractal spectra. Theoretically these dynamics are at least the result of a competition between elastic energies and disorder, which leads to the emergence of collective behaviours. Mathematically, the universality classes involved are not those corresponding to the central limit theorem, but generalize it in its more elaborated forms (Levy &amp; Gnedenko). A class has recently been described completely: directed polymers on a random medium. Scaling exponents are known, together with the fluctuations' statistics. Large deviation theory plays a central role. The fixed point of the associated dynamics is that of KPZ (Kardar-Parisi-Zhang). We have indications that heartbeat dynamics in episodes of atrial fibrillation belongs to that class. In such a context, the questions raised relate to finite size effects when asymptotic convergence is slow. From an experimental point of view, the problem of determining universality classes is very hard. However, it is possible to formulate hypothesis on the universality class so as to extract important information from acquisition signals. A good modus operandi consists in using key properties of a model stated <i>a priori</i>, to combine them with experimental signal analysis in order to produce <i>a posteriori</i> characteristics of interest. Last year, we developed the first model of cardiac dynamics compatible with observed data. The model allows us to test the efficiency of a combined methodology using singularity exponents and Bayesian analysis. This has led us to a first automatic method able to identify periods of cardiac activity and make the distinction with measure noise. From this, the fine automatic determination of activity periods become tractable. This will lead to an automatic quantitative determination of fragmentation, hence opening the way for a determination of universality classes. We illustrate some steps in the figures below.</p>

Then Region Growing process is used to filter out the remaining noisy structures in the offshort waters. The methodology is used to provide a satistical view of the spatial and temporal variability of the Moroccan upwelling activity.

      <p noindent="true">Current state-of-the-art denoising methods such as non-local low-rank approaches are mainly tuned to work with uniform Gaussian noise corruption and known variance, which is far from the real noise scenario. Noise level estimation is already a challenging problem and denoising methods are quite sensitive to this parameter. Moreover, these methods are based on shrinkage models that are too simple to reflect reality, which results in over-smoothing of important structures such as small-scale text and textures. We propose a new approach for more realistic image restoration based on the concept of low-rankness transfer (LRT).</p>

      <p noindent="true">The long-term success of a dental implant is related to the properties of the bone-implant interface. It is important to follow the evolution of bone remodeling phenomena around the implant. Methods based on ultrasound wave propagation were already successfully used by collaborators, in the qualitative and quantitative evaluation of primary and secondary stability of dental implants. Results, numerical and experimental, are analysed with signal processing tools based on multifractal methods. Analysis of the first results shows that these methods are potentially efficient in this case because they can explore and exploit the multi-scale structure of the signal.</p>

      <p noindent="true">Action potentials play an important role in the dynamics of cell-cell communication and they are thus of key relevance in neural tissues. We show that typical real-world electrophysiological signals, with smooth deviations from harmonicity, are typically well described with just the first few terms and result in a rather compact, sparse representation. In particular, we have done an analysis of FitzHugh-Nagumo impulse trains; we have found that 3 anharmonic terms reconstruct better than an equivalent 8-term Fourier representation, with less than half the PSNR and no artifacts from Gibbs phenomenon.</p>

            <p noindent="true">The OptIC associated team targets the extension and development of a strong collaboration between Inria GEOSTAT team and INDIAN INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY ROORKEE Dept of Electronics and Computer Engineering (Prof. D. Singh's group) on non-linear Signal Processing for Universe Sciences, with a strong emphasis on data fusion in Earth Observation and monitoring. Non-linear Physics puts strong evidence of the fundamental role played by multiscale hierarchies in complex and turbulent data: in these data, the information content is statistically localized in geometrical arrangements in the signal's domain, while such geometrical organization is not attainable by classical methods in linear signal processing. This is one of the major drawbacks in the classical analysis of complex and turbulent signals. The goal of this associated team is to show that inference of physical variables along the scales of complex and turbulent signals can be performed through optimal multiresolution analysis performed on non-linear features and data extracted from the signals, resulting in novel and powerful approaches for data fusion between different acquisitions (in temporal/spatial/spectral resolutions). This program needs both strong expertise in the physical processes beyond the acquisitions and the application of non-linear physics ideas on the behavior of the acquired physical phenomena. The proposal will focus on specific applications in Earth Observation and monitoring for which the Indian partner has developed a very strong expertise, notably in its knowledge and use of the physical processes in remote sensing acquisitions. This partnership is an extremely interesting and high potential collaboration between two teams which focus separately either on the acquisition of the physical processes or their analysis by Complex Systems and non-linear physics methodologies. The recent results obtained in super-resolution by GEOSTAT promises strong applications to a much wider range of Universe Sciences problems, notably with a strong emphasis on data fusion between the physical variables acquired on related but different acquisitions. OptiC builds on a collaboration between Inria and IIT ROORKEE teams, added with partners in Universe Sciences and earth observation (ONERA, CNRS) already involved in research actions with GEOSTAT.</p>
