      <p>The foundational work of the team focuses on <i>structural</i> and
<i>analytic</i> proof theory, <i>i.e.</i>, the study of formal
proofs as algebraic and combinatorial structures and the study of
proof systems as deductive and computational formalisms. The main
focus in recent years has been the study of the <i>sequent
calculus</i> and of the <i>deep inference</i> formalisms.</p>
      <p>An important research question is how to reason about computational
specifications that are written in a <i>relational</i> style. To
this end, the team has been developing new approaches to dealing
with induction, co-induction, and generic quantification. A second
important question is of <i>canonicity</i> in deductive systems,
<i>i.e.</i>, when are two derivations “essentially the same”? This
crucial question is important not only for proof search, because it
gives an insight into the structure and an ability to manipulate the
proof search space, but also for the communication of <i>proof
objects</i> between different reasoning agents such as automated
theorem provers and proof checkers.</p>

      <bodyTitle>General overview</bodyTitle>
      <p>There are two broad approaches for computational specifications. In
the <i>computation as model</i> approach, computations are encoded as
mathematical structures containing nodes, transitions, and state.
Logic is used to <i>describe</i> these structures, that is, the
computations are used as models for logical expressions. Intensional
operators, such as the modals of temporal and dynamic logics or the
triples of Hoare logic, are often employed to express propositions
about the change in state.</p>
      <p>The <i>computation as deduction</i> approach, in contrast, expresses
computations logically, using formulas, terms, types, and proofs as
computational elements. Unlike the model approach, general logical
apparatus such as cut-elimination or automated deduction becomes
directly applicable as tools for defining, analyzing, and animating
computations. Indeed, we can identify two main aspects of logical
specifications that have been very fruitful:</p>
      <simplelist>
        <li id="uid16">
          <p noindent="true"><i>Proof normalization</i>, which treats the state of a
computation as a proof term and computation as normalization of the
proof terms. General reduction principles such as <formula type="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" overflow="scroll"><mi>β</mi></math></formula>-reduction
or cut-elimination are merely particular forms of proof
normalization. Functional programming is based on
normalization  <ref xlink:href="#parsifal-2016-bid0" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>, and normalization in different
logics can justify the design of new and different functional
programming languages  <ref xlink:href="#parsifal-2016-bid1" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>.</p>
        </li>
        <li id="uid17">
          <p noindent="true"><i>Proof search</i>, which views the state of a computation as a
a structured collection of formulas, known as a <i>sequent</i>, and
proof search in a suitable sequent calculus as encoding the dynamics
of the computation. Logic programming is based on proof
search  <ref xlink:href="#parsifal-2016-bid2" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>, and different proof search
strategies can be used to justify the design of new and different
logic programming languages  <ref xlink:href="#parsifal-2016-bid3" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>.</p>
        </li>
      </simplelist>
      <p>While the distinction between these two aspects is somewhat informal,
it helps to identify and classify different concerns that arise in
computational semantics. For instance, confluence and termination of
reductions are crucial considerations for normalization, while
unification and strategies are important for search. A key challenge
of computational logic is to find means of uniting or reorganizing
these apparently disjoint concerns.</p>
      <p>An important organizational principle is structural proof theory,
that is, the study of proofs as syntactic, algebraic and
combinatorial objects. Formal proofs often have equivalences in
their syntactic representations, leading to an important research
question about <i>canonicity</i> in proofs – when are two proofs
“essentially the same?” The syntactic equivalences can be used to
derive normal forms for proofs that illuminate not only the proofs
of a given formula, but also its entire proof search space. The
celebrated <i>focusing</i> theorem of
Andreoli <ref xlink:href="#parsifal-2016-bid4" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/> identifies one such normal form
for derivations in the sequent calculus that has many important
consequences both for search and for computation. The combinatorial
structure of proofs can be further explored with the use of
<i>deep inference</i>; in particular, deep inference allows access
to simple and manifestly correct cut-elimination procedures with
precise complexity bounds.</p>
      <p>Type theory is another important organizational principle, but most
popular type systems are generally designed for either search or for
normalization. To give some examples, the Coq
system  <ref xlink:href="#parsifal-2016-bid5" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/> that implements the Calculus of Inductive
Constructions (CIC) is designed to facilitate the expression of
computational features of proofs directly as executable functional
programs, but general proof search techniques for Coq are rather
primitive. In contrast, the Twelf system  <ref xlink:href="#parsifal-2016-bid6" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>
that is based on the LF type theory (a subsystem of the CIC), is
based on relational specifications in canonical form (<i>i.e.</i>,
without redexes) for which there are sophisticated automated
reasoning systems such as meta-theoretic analysis tools, logic
programming engines, and inductive theorem provers. In recent years,
there has been a push towards combining search and normalization in
the same type-theoretic framework. The Beluga
system  <ref xlink:href="#parsifal-2016-bid7" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>, for example, is an extension of
the LF type theory with a purely computational meta-framework where
operations on inductively defined LF objects can be expressed as
functional programs.</p>
      <p>The Parsifal team investigates both the search and the normalization
aspects of computational specifications using the concepts, results,
and insights from proof theory and type theory.</p>
    </subsection>
    <subsection id="uid18" level="1">
      <bodyTitle>Inductive and co-inductive reasoning</bodyTitle>
      <p>The team has spent a number of years in designing a strong new logic
that can be used to reason (inductively and co-inductively) on
syntactic expressions containing bindings. This work is based on
earlier work by McDowell, Miller, and Tiu <ref xlink:href="#parsifal-2016-bid8" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>
<ref xlink:href="#parsifal-2016-bid9" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/> <ref xlink:href="#parsifal-2016-bid10" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>
<ref xlink:href="#parsifal-2016-bid11" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>, and on more recent work by Gacek, Miller, and
Nadathur <ref xlink:href="#parsifal-2016-bid12" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/> <ref xlink:href="#parsifal-2016-bid13" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>. The Parsifal
team, along with our colleagues in Minneapolis, Canberra,
Singapore, and Cachen, have been building two tools that exploit the
novel features of this logic. These two systems are the following.</p>
      <simplelist>
        <li id="uid19">
          <p noindent="true">Abella, which is an interactive theorem prover for the full logic.</p>
        </li>
        <li id="uid20">
          <p noindent="true">Bedwyr, which is a model checker for the “finite” part of the logic.</p>
        </li>
      </simplelist>
      <p>We have used these systems to provide formalize reasoning of a number
of complex formal systems, ranging from programming languages to the
<formula type="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" overflow="scroll"><mi>λ</mi></math></formula>-calculus and <formula type="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" overflow="scroll"><mi>π</mi></math></formula>-calculus.</p>
      <p>Since 2014, the Abella system has been extended with a number of new
features. A number of new significant examples have been implemented
in Abella and an extensive tutorial for it has been
written <ref xlink:href="#parsifal-2016-bid14" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>.</p>
    </subsection>
    <subsection id="uid21" level="1">
      <bodyTitle>Developing a foundational
approach to defining proof evidence</bodyTitle>
      <p>The team is developing a framework for defining the semantics of proof
evidence. With this framework, implementers of theorem provers can
output proof evidence in a format of their choice: they will only need
to be able to formally define that evidence's semantics. With such
semantics provided, proof checkers can then check alleged proofs for
correctness. Thus, anyone who needs to trust proofs from various
provers can put their energies into designing trustworthy checkers that
can execute the semantic specification.</p>
      <p>In order to provide our framework with the flexibility that this
ambitious plan requires, we have based our design on the most recent
advances within the theory of proofs. For a number of years, various
team members have been contributing to the design and theory of
<i>focused proof systems</i> <ref xlink:href="#parsifal-2016-bid15" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>
<ref xlink:href="#parsifal-2016-bid16" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/> <ref xlink:href="#parsifal-2016-bid17" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/> <ref xlink:href="#parsifal-2016-bid18" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>
<ref xlink:href="#parsifal-2016-bid19" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/> <ref xlink:href="#parsifal-2016-bid20" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/> <ref xlink:href="#parsifal-2016-bid21" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/> and we have
adopted such proof systems as the corner stone for our framework.</p>
      <p>We have also been working for a number of years on the implementation
of computational logic systems, involving, for example, both
unification and backtracking search. As a result, we are also
building an early and reference implementation of our semantic
definitions.</p>
    </subsection>
    <subsection id="uid22" level="1">
      <bodyTitle>Deep inference</bodyTitle>
      <p>Deep inference <ref xlink:href="#parsifal-2016-bid22" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>, <ref xlink:href="#parsifal-2016-bid23" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>
is a novel methodology for presenting deductive
systems. Unlike traditional formalisms like the sequent calculus, it
allows rewriting of formulas deep inside arbitrary contexts. The new
freedom for designing inference rules creates a richer proof
theory. For example, for systems using deep inference, we have a
greater variety of normal forms for proofs than in sequent calculus or
natural deduction systems. Another advantage of deep inference systems
is the close relationship to categorical proof theory. Due to the deep
inference design one can directly read off the morphism from the
derivations. There is no need for a counter-intuitive translation.</p>

      <bodyTitle>Proof nets and atomic flows</bodyTitle>
      <p>Proof nets and atomic flows are abstract (graph-like) presentations
of proofs such that all "trivial rule permutations" are quotiented
away. Ideally the notion of proof net should be independent from any
syntactic formalism, but most notions of proof nets proposed in the past
were formulated in terms of their relation to the sequent calculus.
Consequently we could observe features like “boxes” and explicit
“contraction links”. The latter appeared not only in Girard's
proof nets <ref xlink:href="#parsifal-2016-bid24" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/> for linear logic but also in
Robinson's proof nets <ref xlink:href="#parsifal-2016-bid25" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/> for classical
logic. In this kind of proof nets every link in the net corresponds
to a rule application in the sequent calculus.</p>
      <p>Only recently, due to the rise of deep inference, new kinds of proof
nets have been introduced that take the formula trees of the
conclusions and add additional “flow-graph” information (see e.g.,
<ref xlink:href="#parsifal-2016-bid26" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>, <ref xlink:href="#parsifal-2016-bid27" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>
and  <ref xlink:href="#parsifal-2016-bid28" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>. On one side, this gives new insights
in the essence of proofs and their normalization. But on the other
side, all the known correctness criteria are no longer available.</p>
      <p>This directly leads to the following research questions investigated

      <bodyTitle>Cost Models and Abstract Machines for Functional Programs</bodyTitle>
      <p>In the <i>proof normalization</i> approach, computation is usually reformulated as the evaluation of functional programs, expressed as terms in a variation over the <formula type="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" overflow="scroll"><mi>λ</mi></math></formula>-calculus. Thanks to
its higher-order nature, this approach provides very concise and abstract
specifications. Its strength is however also its weakness: the abstraction
from physical machines is pushed to a level where it is no longer
clear how to measure the complexity of an algorithm.</p>
      <p>Models like Turing machines or RAM rely on atomic computational steps and thus admit quite obvious cost models for time and space. The <formula type="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" overflow="scroll"><mi>λ</mi></math></formula>-calculus instead relies on a single non-atomic operation, <formula type="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" overflow="scroll"><mi>β</mi></math></formula>-reduction, for which costs in terms of time and space are far from evident.</p>
      <p>Nonetheless, it turns out that the number of <formula type="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" overflow="scroll"><mi>β</mi></math></formula>-steps is a reasonable time cost model, i.e.,it is polynomially related to those of Turing machines and RAM. For the special case of <i>weak evaluation</i> (i.e., reducing only <formula type="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" overflow="scroll"><mi>β</mi></math></formula>-steps that are not under abstractions)—which is used to model functional programming languages—this is a relatively old result due to Blelloch and Greiner  <ref xlink:href="#parsifal-2016-bid29" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/> (1995). It is only very recently (2014) that the strong case—used in the implementation models of proof assistants—has been solved by Accattoli and Dal Lago <ref xlink:href="#parsifal-2016-bid30" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>.</p>

      <bodyTitle>Integrating a model checker and a theorem prover</bodyTitle>
      <p>The goal of combining model checking with inductive and co-inductive
theorem is appealing. The strengths of systems in these
two different approaches are strikingly different. A model checker is
capable of exploring a finite space automatically: such a tool can
repeatedly explore all possible cases of a given computational
space. On the other hand, a theorem prover might be able to prove
abstract properties about a search space. For example, a model checker
could attempt to discover whether or not there exists a winning
strategy for, say, tic-tac-toe while an inductive theorem prover might
be able to prove that if there is a winning strategy for one board
then there is a winning strategy for any symmetric version of that
board. Of course, the ability to combine proofs from these systems
could drastically reduce the amount of state exploration and
verification of proof certificates that are needed to prove the
existence of winning strategies.</p>
      <p>Our first step to providing an integration of model checking and
(inductive) theorem proving was the development of a strong logic,
that we call <formula type="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" overflow="scroll"><mi>𝒢</mi></math></formula>, which extends intuitionistic logic with notions
of least and greatest fixed points. We had developed the proof theory
of this logic in earlier papers <ref xlink:href="#parsifal-2016-bid12" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>
<ref xlink:href="#parsifal-2016-bid13" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>. We have now recently converted the Bedwyr
system so that it formally accepts almost all definitions and theorem
statements that are accepted by the inductive theorem prover Abella.
Thus, these two systems are proving theorems in the same logic and
their results can now be shared.</p>
      <p>Bedwyr's tabling mechanism has been extended so that its it can make
use of previously proved lemmas. For instance, when trying to prove
that some board position has a winning strategy, an available stored
lemma can now be used to obtain the result if some symmetric board
position is already in the table.</p>
      <p>Heath and Miller have shown how model checking can be seen as
constructing proof in (linear) logic <ref xlink:href="#parsifal-2016-bid31" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>.
For more about recent progress on providing checkable proof
certificates for model checking, see the web site for Bedwyr

    <subsection id="uid33" level="1">
      <bodyTitle>Implementing trusted proof checkers</bodyTitle>
      <p>Traditionally, theorem provers—whether interactive or
automatic—are usually monolithic: if any part of a formal
development was to be done in a particular theorem prover, then the
whole of it would need to be done in that prover. Increasingly,
however, formal systems are being developed to integrate the results
returned from several, independent and high-performance, specialized
provers: see, for example, the integration of Isabelle with an SMT
solver <ref xlink:href="#parsifal-2016-bid32" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/> as well as the Why3 and ESC/Java
systems.</p>
      <p>Within the Parsifal team, we have been working on foundational aspects
of this multi-prover integration problem. As we have
described above, we have been developing a formal framework for
defining the semantics of proof evidence. We have also been working
on prototype checkers of proof evidence which are capable of
executing such formal definitions. The proof definition language
described in the papers <ref xlink:href="#parsifal-2016-bid33" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>, <ref xlink:href="#parsifal-2016-bid34" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/> is
currently given an implementation in the <formula type="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" overflow="scroll"><mi>λ</mi></math></formula>Prolog programming
language <ref xlink:href="#parsifal-2016-bid35" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>. This initial implementation will
be able to serve as a “reference” proof checker: others who are developing
proof evidence definitions will be able to use this reference checker
to make sure that they are getting their definitions to do what they
expect.</p>
      <p>Using <formula type="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" overflow="scroll"><mi>λ</mi></math></formula>Prolog as an implementation language has both good and
bad points. The good points are that it is rather simple to confirm
that the checker is, in fact, sound. The language also supports a
rich set of abstracts which make it impossible to interfere with the
code of the checker (no injection attacks are possible). On the
negative side, the performance of our <formula type="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" overflow="scroll"><mi>λ</mi></math></formula>Prolog interpreters is
lower than that of specially written checkers and kernels.</p>

      <bodyTitle>Trustworthy implementations of theorem proving techniques</bodyTitle>
      <p>Instead of integrating different provers by exchanging proof
evidence and relying on a backend proof-checker, another approach
to integration consists in re-implementing the theorem proving
techniques as proof-search strategies, on an architecture that
guarantees correctness. Focused systems can serve as the basis of
such an architecture, identifying points for choice and backtracking, and
providing primitives for the exploration of the search space. These
form a trusted <i>Application Programming Interface</i> that can be
used to program and experiment various proof-search heuristics
without worrying about correctness. No proof-checking is needed if
one trusts the implementation of the API.</p>
      <p>This approach has led to the development of the Psyche engine.</p>
      <p>Two major research directions are currently being explored, based on
the above:</p>
      <simplelist>
        <li id="uid35">
          <p noindent="true">The first one is about understanding how to deal with
quantifiers in presence of one or more theories: On the one hand,
traditional techniques for quantified problems, such as
<i>unification</i>  <ref xlink:href="#parsifal-2016-bid36" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/> or <i>quantifier
elimination</i> are usually designed for either the empty theory or
very specific theories. On the other hand, the industrial
techniques for combining theories (Nelson-Oppen, Shostak, MCSAT  <ref xlink:href="#parsifal-2016-bid37" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>, <ref xlink:href="#parsifal-2016-bid38" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>, <ref xlink:href="#parsifal-2016-bid39" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>, <ref xlink:href="#parsifal-2016-bid40" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>) are
designed for quantifier-free problems, and quantifiers there are
dealt with incomplete <i>clause instantiation</i> methods or
<i>trigger</i>-based techniques  <ref xlink:href="#parsifal-2016-bid41" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>. We are
working on making the two approaches compatible.</p>
        </li>
        <li id="uid36">
          <p noindent="true">The above architecture's modular approach raises the
question of how its different modules can safely cooperate (in
terms of guaranteed correctness), while some of them are trusted
and others are not. The issue is particularly acute if some of the
techniques are run concurrently and exchange data at unpredictable
times. For this we explore new solutions based on Milner's <i>LCF</i>  <ref xlink:href="#parsifal-2016-bid42" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>. In  <ref xlink:href="#parsifal-2016-bid43" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>,
we argued that our solutions in particular provide a way to fulfil
the “Strategy Challenge for SMT-solving” set by De Moura and
Passmore  <ref xlink:href="#parsifal-2016-bid44" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>.</p>

        <span class="smallcap" align="left">Functional Description</span>
      </p>
      <p>Bedwyr is a generalization of logic programming that allows model checking directly on syntactic expression that possibly contain bindings. This system, written in OCaml, is a direct implementation of two recent advances in the theory of proof search.</p>
      <p>It is possible to capture both finite success and finite failure in a sequent calculus. Proof search in such a proof system can capture both may and must behavior in operational semantics.
Higher-order abstract syntax is directly supported using term-level lambda-binders, the nabla quantifier, higher-order pattern unification, and explicit substitutions. These features allow reasoning directly on expressions containing bound variables.</p>
      <p>The distributed system comes with several example applications, including the finite pi-calculus (operational semantics, bisimulation, trace analyses, and modal logics), the spi-calculus (operational semantics), value-passing CCS, the lambda-calculus, winning strategies for games, and various other model checking problems.</p>

invesigated. For example, we have found that the medial rule which
plays a central role in deep inference systems is canonical in a
strong sense: It is minimal, and every rule that reduce contraction
to an atomic form is indeed derivable via medial. This is published

      <p>Focusing is a general technique for transforming a sequent
proof system into one with a syntactic separation of non-deterministic
choices without sacrificing completeness. This not only improves proof
search, but also has the representational benefit of distilling sequent proofs
into synthetic normal forms. We have shown how to apply the focusing technique
to nested sequent calculi, a generalization of ordinary sequent calculi
to tree-like instead of list-like structures. We thus improve the reach of
focusing to the most commonly studied modal logics, the logics of the
modal S5 cube. Among our key contributions is a focused cut-elimination
theorem for focused nested sequents. This is published in <ref xlink:href="#parsifal-2016-bid49" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>.</p>
      <p>Then we further extend our results to intuitionistic nested sequents, which can
capture all the logics of the intuitionistic S5 cube in a modular fashion. We obtained an internal
cut-elimination procedure for the focused system which in turn is used to show its completeness.

are two methodologies that allow the reasoning mechanisms of different theories to collaborate, in order to tackle hybrid problems.
While these methodologies are often used and implemented for the practical applications of Automated Reasoning,
their rather sophisticated foundations are traditionally explained in terms of model theory.
SRI International pioneered some work
providing such methodologies with new and more general foundations in terms of <i>inference systems</i>  <ref xlink:href="#parsifal-2016-bid51" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>,
closer to proof theory and to Parsifal's research.
The more recent MCSAT methodology was not captured,
more generally lacked any kind of theorem about the generic combination of arbitrary theories,
and was also thought to be incompatible with the Nelson-Oppen approach,
so that SMT-solvers are either working with one methodology or the other, unable to get the best of both worlds.</p>
      <p>In 2016 we designed a combination methodology, based on <i>inference systems</i>, that supersedes both Nelson-Oppen and MCSAT <ref xlink:href="#parsifal-2016-bid52" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>.
We showed its soundness and completeness, and identified for this the properties that the theories to combine are required to satisfy.
This generalized MCSAT with the generic combination mechanism that it lacked,
and showed that it is perfectly compatible with the Nelson-Oppen methodology, which can now cohabit within the same solver.

      <p>Recent studies of the combinatorics of linear lambda calculus have uncovered some unexpected connections to the old and well-developed theory of graphs embedded on surfaces (also known as “maps”) <ref xlink:href="#parsifal-2016-bid53" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>, <ref xlink:href="#parsifal-2016-bid54" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>, <ref xlink:href="#parsifal-2016-bid55" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>.
In <ref xlink:href="#parsifal-2016-bid56" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>, we aimed to give a simple and conceptual account for one of these connections, namely the correspondence (originally described by Bodini, Gardy, and Jacquot <ref xlink:href="#parsifal-2016-bid53" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>) between <formula type="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" overflow="scroll"><mi>α</mi></math></formula>-equivalence classes of closed linear lambda terms and isomorphism classes of rooted trivalent maps on compact oriented surfaces without boundary.
One immediate application of this new account was a characterization of trivalent maps which are <i>bridgeless</i> (in the graph-theoretic sense of having no disconnecting edge) as linear lambda terms with no closed proper subterms.
In turn, this lead to a surprising but natural reformulation of the
Four Color Theorem as a statement about typing in lambda calculus.

      <p>In joint work with Paul-André Melliès, we have been investigating the categorical semantics of type refinement systems, which are type systems built “on top of” a typed programming language to specify and verify more precise properties of programs.
The fibrational view of type refinement we have been developing (cf.  <ref xlink:href="#parsifal-2016-bid57" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>) is closely related to the categorical perspective on first-order logic introduced by Lawvere <ref xlink:href="#parsifal-2016-bid58" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>, but with some important conceptual and technical differences that provide an opportunity for reflection.
For example, Lawvere's axiomatization of first-order logic (his theory of so-called “hyperdoctrines”) was based on the idea that existential and universal quantification can be described respectively as left and right adjoints to the operation of substitution, this giving rise to a family of <i>adjoint triples</i> <formula type="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" overflow="scroll"><mrow><msub><mi>Σ</mi><mi>f</mi></msub><mo>⊣</mo><msub><mi>𝒫</mi><mi>f</mi></msub><mo>⊣</mo><msub><mi>Π</mi><mi>f</mi></msub></mrow></math></formula> (one such triple for every function <formula type="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" overflow="scroll"><mrow><mi>f</mi><mo>:</mo><mi>A</mi><mo>→</mo><mi>B</mi></mrow></math></formula>).
On the other hand, a bifibration only induces a family of <i>adjoint pairs</i> <formula type="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" overflow="scroll"><mrow><msub><mi>𝗉𝗎𝗌𝗁</mi><mi>f</mi></msub><mo>⊣</mo><msub><mi>𝗉𝗎𝗅𝗅</mi><mi>f</mi></msub></mrow></math></formula> (again, one such pair for every <formula type="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" overflow="scroll"><mrow><mi>f</mi><mo>:</mo><mi>A</mi><mo>→</mo><mi>B</mi></mrow></math></formula>).
In <ref xlink:href="#parsifal-2016-bid59" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>, we resolved this and other apparent mismatches by applying ideas inspired by the semantics of linear logic and the shift from the cartesian closed category <formula type="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" overflow="scroll"><mi>𝐒𝐞𝐭</mi></math></formula> to the symmetric monoidal closed category <formula type="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" overflow="scroll"><mi>𝐑𝐞𝐥</mi></math></formula>.
Two other applications of our analysis include an axiomatic treatment of <i>directed</i> equality predicates (which can be modelled as “hom” presheaves, realizing an early vision of Lawvere), as well as a simple calculus of string diagrams that is highly reminiscent of C. S. Peirce's “existential graphs” for predicate logic.</p>

      <p>Continuation-passing style translations make a functional program
more explicit by sequentializing its computations and reifying its
control. They have been used as an intermediate language in many
compilers. They are also understood as classical-to-intuitionistic
proof embedding (so-called double negation translations). Matthias
Puech studied a novel correspondence between CPS and focusing: to
each CPS transform corresponds a focused proof system that is
identifiable as a particular polarization of classical
statements. Since, after Miller's and others work, we know the full
design space of focused sequent calculi, we expect to understand the
full design space of CPS translation.</p>
      <p>The first step of this goal is to study the syntax and typing of
variants of the CPS translation. Puech designed and implemented in
OCaml a compacting, optimizing CPS translation, while using OCaml's
type system to verify that it maps well-typed terms to well-typed
terms in a tightly restricted syntactical form (the “typeful”
approach to formalization) <ref xlink:href="#parsifal-2016-bid60" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>. The
resulting type system is in Curry-Howard isomorphism with a weakly

      <p>In a world where trusting software systems is increasingly important,
formal methods and formal proofs can help provide some basis for trust.
Proof checking can help to reduce the size of the <i>trusted base</i>
since we do not need to trust an entire theorem prover: instead, we
only need to trust a (smaller and simpler) proof checker.
Many approaches to building proof checkers require embedding within them
a full programming language.
In most modern proof checkers and theorem provers, that
programming language is a functional programming language, often a
variant of ML.
In fact, aspects of ML (e.g., strong typing, abstract data types, and
higher-order programming) were designed to make ML a trustworthy
“meta-language” for checking proofs.
While there is considerable overlap between logic programming and
proof checking (e.g., both benefit from unification, backtracking
search, efficient term structures, etc), the discipline of logic
programming has, in fact, played a minor role in the history of proof
checking.
Miller has been pushing the argument that logic programming can have a
major role in the future of this important topic <ref xlink:href="#parsifal-2016-bid61" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>.
Many aspects of the ProofCert project are based on this perspective
that logic programming techniques and methods can have significant
utility within proof checking.
This perspective stands in constrast to the work on the Dedukti proof
checking framework <ref xlink:href="#parsifal-2016-bid62" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/> where functional programming
principles are employed for proof checking.

      <p>The kinds of inference rules and decision procedures that one writes
for proofs involving equality and rewriting are rather different from
proofs that one might write in first-order logic using, say, sequent
calculus or natural deduction. For example, equational logic proofs
are often chains of replacements or applications of oriented rewriting
and normal forms. In contrast, proofs involving logical connectives
are trees of introduction and elimination rules. Chihani and Miller
have shown <ref xlink:href="#parsifal-2016-bid63" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/> how it is possible to check
various equality-based proof systems with a programmable proof checker
(the <i>kernel</i> checker) for first-order logic. That proof
checker's design is based on the implementation of <i>focused proof
search</i> and on making calls to (user-supplied) <i>clerks and
experts</i> predicates that are tied to the two phases found in focused
proofs. This particular design is based on the work of Chihani,
Miller, and Renaud <ref xlink:href="#parsifal-2016-bid64" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>.</p>
      <p>The specification of these clerks and experts provide a formal
definition of the structure of proof evidence and they work just as
well in the equational setting as in the logic setting where this
scheme for proof checking was originally developed. Additionally,
executing such a formal definition on top of a kernel provides an
actual proof checker that can also do a degree of proof
reconstruction. A number of rewriting based proofs have been defined
and checked in this manner.

      <p>Unification is a central operation in the construction of a range of
computational logic systems based on first-order and higher-order
logics.
First-order unification has a number of properties that dominates the
way it is incorporated within such systems.
In particular, first-order unification is decidable, unary, and can
be performed on untyped term structures.
None of these three properties hold for full higher-order unification:
unification is undecidable, unifiers can be incomparable, and
term-level typing can dominate the search for unifiers.
The so-called <i>pattern</i> subset of higher-order unification was
designed to be a small extension to first-order unification that
respected the basic laws governing <formula type="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" overflow="scroll"><mi>λ</mi></math></formula>-binding (the equalities
of <formula type="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" overflow="scroll"><mi>α</mi></math></formula>, <formula type="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" overflow="scroll"><mi>β</mi></math></formula>, and <formula type="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" overflow="scroll"><mi>η</mi></math></formula>-conversion) but which also satisfied
those three properties.
While the pattern fragment of higher-order unification has been
popular in various implemented systems and in various theoretical
considerations, it is too weak for a number of applications.
Libal and Miller <ref xlink:href="#parsifal-2016-bid65" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/> have defined an extension
of pattern unification that is motivated by some existing applications
and which satisfies these three properties.
The main idea behind their extension is that the arguments to a
higher-order, free variable can be more than just distinct bound
variables: they can also be terms constructed from (sufficient numbers
of) such variables using term constructors and where no argument is a
subterm of any other argument.
This extension to pattern unification satisfies the three properties
mentioned above.
R. Blanco is currently adding this extended unification to the Abella
theorem prover.

      <p>Several deductive formalisms (e.g., sequent, nested sequent, labeled
sequent, hypersequent calculi) have been used in the literature for
the treatment of modal logics, and some connections between these
formalisms are already known. Marin, Miller, and Volpe
<ref xlink:href="#parsifal-2016-bid66" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/> have propose a general framework, which is
based on a focused version of the labeled sequent calculus by Negri
<ref xlink:href="#parsifal-2016-bid67" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>, augmented with some parametric devices
allowing to restrict the set of proofs. By properly defining such
restrictions and by choosing an appropriate polarization of formulas,
one can obtain different, concrete proof systems for the modal logic K
and for its extensions by means of geometric axioms.
The expressiveness of the labeled approach and the
control mechanisms of focusing allow a clean emulation
of a range of existing formalisms and proof systems for
modal logic.
These results make it possible to write Foundational Proof Certificate
definitions of common modal logic proof systems.</p>

The approximation introduced by finite-precision representation of
continuous data can induce arbitrarily large information leaks even
when the computation using exact semantics is secure. Such leakage can
thus undermine design efforts aimed at protecting sensitive
information. Gazeau, Miller, and Palamidessi
<ref xlink:href="#parsifal-2016-bid68" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/> have applied differential privacy—an
approach to privacy that emerged from the area of statistical
databases—to this problem. In their approach, privacy is protected
by the addition of noise to a true (private) value. To date, this
approach to privacy has been proved correct only in the ideal case in
which computations are made using an idealized, infinite-precision
semantics. An analysis of implementation levels, where the semantics
is necessarily finite-precision, i.e. the representation of real
numbers and the operations on them are rounded according to some level
of precision. In general there are violations of the differential
privacy property but a limited (but, arguably, totally acceptable)
variant of the property can be used insteand, under only a minor
degradation of the privacy level. In fact, two cases of
noise-generating distributions can be employed: the standard Laplacian
mechanism commonly used in differential privacy, and a bivariate
version of the Laplacian recently introduced in the setting of
privacy-aware geolocation.</p>

      <p>First-order resolution theorem provers depend on efficient data structures for redundancy elimination. These data structures do
not exist for higher-order resolution theorem provers. In
<ref xlink:href="#parsifal-2016-bid70" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/> we discuss a new approach to this
problem. (Joint work with Alexander Steen).

      <p>Functional programming languages are often based on the call-by-value <formula type="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" overflow="scroll"><mi>λ</mi></math></formula>-calculus, whose elegant theory relies on weak evaluation and closed terms, that are natural hypotheses in the study of programming languages. To model proof assistants, however, strong evaluation and open terms are required, and it is well known that the operational semantics of call-by-value becomes problematic in this case. In this joint work with Giulio Guerrieri we studied the intermediate setting—that we call Open Call-by-Value—of weak evaluation with open terms, on top of which Gregoire and Leroy designed the abstract machine of Coq. Various calculi for Open Call-by-Value already exist, each one with its pros and cons. We did a detailed comparative study of the operational semantics of four of them, coming from different areas such as the study of abstract machines, denotational semantics, linear logic proof nets, and sequent calculus. We showed that these calculi are all equivalent from a termination point of view, justifying the slogan Open Call-by-Value.

      <p>Acyclicity constraints can be used to encode a large variety of useful
constraints on graphs. The basic constraint itself can be encoded in terms of
simpler constraints (e.g. integer linear constraints) in a straightforward and
intuitive way, associating to each vertex of the (fixed) input graph a variable
with domain linear in the size of the graph. For large graphs, this quickly
becomes inefficient.</p>
      <p>In <ref xlink:href="#parsifal-2016-bid73" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>, we show that in the case of planar graphs,
a more efficient encoding (using a two-valued variable per vertex) is possible.

      <p>In sequent calculi, proof rules can be divided into two groups:
invertible (asynchronous) proof rules and non-invertible
(synchronous) proof rules. Even in focusing sequent calculi the
two groups of rules are present, albeit grouped together in
synthetic rules (we speak of the synchronous and asynchronous
phase).</p>
      <p>In this work, we used the exp-log decomposition (described above)
in the context of logic in order to obtain a version of sequent
caclulus which contains synchronous rules only, a first such
formalism for intuitionistic logic.</p>
      <p>We extended the picture from the setting of propositional to the
one of first-order intuitionistic logic, where the exp-log
decomposition provided us with an intuitionistic hierarchy of
formulas analogous to the classical arithmetical hierachy;
although the classical arithmetical hierarchy exists since the
1920s, a correspondingly versatile notion for intuitionistic logic
has been elusive up to this day.</p>

              <p noindent="true">There is little hope that the world will know secure software if we cannot make greater strides in the practice of formal methods: hardware and software devices with errors are routinely turned against their users. The ProofCert proposal aims at building a foundation that will allow a broad spectrum of formal methods—ranging from automatic model checkers to interactive theorem provers—to work together to establish formal properties of computer systems. This project starts with a wonderful gift to us from decades of work by logicians and proof theorist: their efforts on logic and proof has given us a universally accepted means of communicating proofs between people and computer systems. Logic can be used to state desirable security and correctness properties of software and hardware systems and proofs are uncontroversial evidence that statements are, in fact, true. The current state-of-the-art of formal methods used in academics and industry shows, however, that the notion of logic and proof is severely fractured: there is little or no communication between any two such systems. Thus any efforts on computer system correctness is needlessly repeated many time in the many different systems: sometimes this work is even redone when a given prover is upgraded. In ProofCert, we will build on the bedrock of decades of research into logic and proof theory the notion of proof certificates. Such certificates will allow for a complete reshaping of the way that formal methods are employed. Given the infrastructure and tools envisioned in this proposal, the world of formal methods will become as dynamic and responsive as the world of computer viruses and hackers has become.</p>

          <p>The FISP project is part of a long-term, ambitious project whose objective is to apply the powerful and
promising techniques from structural proof theory to central problems in computer science for which
they have not been used before, especially the understanding of the computational content of proofs,
the extraction of programs from proofs and the logical control of refined computational operations.
So far, the work done in the area of computational interpretations of logical systems is mainly based
on the seminal work of Gentzen, who in the mid-thirties introduced the sequent calculus and natural
deduction, along with the cut-elimination procedure. But that approach shows its limits when it
comes to computational interpretations of classical logic or the modelling of parallel computing. The
aim of our project, based on the complementary skills of the teams, is to overcome these limits. For
instance, deep inference provides new properties, namely full symmetry and atomicity, which were not
available until recently and opened new possibilities at the computing level, in the era of parallel and
distributed computing.</p>

          <p>The COCA HOLA project aims at developing complexity analyses of higher-order computations, i.e. that approach to computation where the inputs and outputs of a program are not simply numbers, strings, or compound data-types, but programs themselves. The focus is not on analysing fixed programs, but whole programming languages. The aim is the identification of adequate units of measurement for time and space, i.e. what are called reasonable cost models. The problem is non-trivial because the evaluation of higher-order languages is defined abstractly, via high-level operations, leaving the implementation unspecified. Concretely, the project will analyse different implementation schemes, measuring precisely their computational complexity with respect to the number of high-level operations, and eventually develop more efficient new ones. The goal is to obtain a complexity-aware theory of implementations of higher-order languages with both theoretical and practical downfalls.</p>
          <p>The projects stems from recent advances on the theory of time cost models for the lambda-calculus, the computational model behind the higher-order approach, obtained by the principal investigator and his collaborators (who are included in the project).</p>

          <p>Modal logics are obtained from propositional logics by adding
modalities <formula type="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" overflow="scroll"><mo>□</mo></math></formula> and <formula type="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" overflow="scroll"><mo>⋄</mo></math></formula>, meaning necessity and
possibility. Originally studied by philosophers in order to reason
about knowledge and belief, modal logics have nowadays many
applications in computer science. Well known examples are epistemic
logics, which allow to formally reason about the knowledge of
independently acting and interacting agents, temporal logics, which
allow to reason about temporal properties of processes, and
authentication logics, which are used to formally reason about
authentication protocols.</p>
          <p>The purpose of this project is to develop a proof theory for variants
of modal logic that have applications in modern computer science but
that have been neglected by traditional proof theory so far.</p>

allow classical and intuitionistic logic to be mixed in a common proof
system.
Miller is exploring how the resulting ideas might be able to
reorganize the notion of kernel logic used within the ProofCert
project.</p>
