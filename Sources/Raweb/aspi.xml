      <p>The scientific objectives of ASPI are the design, analysis and
implementation of interacting Monte Carlo methods, also known as particle

        </li>
      </simplelist>
      <p>The whole problematic is multidisciplinary,
not only because of the many scientific and engineering areas
in which particle methods are used,
but also because of the diversity of the scientific communities
which have already contributed to establish the foundations
of the field</p>
      <p rend="quoted">target tracking,
interacting particle systems,

      <p>Intuitively speaking, interacting Monte Carlo methods are sequential
simulation methods, in which particles</p>
      <simplelist>
        <li id="uid7">
          <p noindent="true"><i>explore</i> the state space by mimicking the evolution

        </li>
        <li id="uid9">
          <p noindent="true">and <i>interact</i> so that only the most successful particles
(in view of the fitness function) are allowed to survive
and to get offsprings at the next generation.</p>
        </li>
      </simplelist>
      <p>The effect of this mutation / selection mechanism is to automatically
concentrate particles (i.e. the available computing power) in regions of
interest of the state space. In the special case of particle filtering,
which has numerous applications under the generic heading of positioning,
navigation and tracking, in</p>
      <p rend="quoted">target tracking,
computer vision,

wireless communications,
ubiquitous computing and ambient intelligence,
sensor networks, etc.,</p>
      <p>each particle represents a possible hidden state, and is replicated
or terminated at the next generation on the basis of its consistency with
the current observation, as quantified by the likelihood function.
With these genetic–type algorithms, it becomes easy to efficiently combine
a prior model of displacement with or without constraints, sensor–based
measurements, and a base of reference measurements, for example in the
form of a digital map (digital elevation map, attenuation map, etc.).
In the most general case, particle methods provide approximations of
Feynman–Kac distributions, a pathwise generalization of Gibbs–Boltzmann
distributions, by means of the weighted empirical probability distribution
associated with an interacting particle system,
with applications that go far beyond filtering, in</p>
      <p rend="quoted">simulation of rare events,
global optimization,
molecular simulation, etc.</p>
      <p>The main applications currently considered are
geolocalisation and tracking of mobile terminals,
terrain–aided navigation,
data fusion for indoor localisation,
optimization of sensors location and activation,
risk assessment in air traffic management,
protection of digital documents.</p>

      <bodyTitle>Interacting Monte Carlo methods
and particle approximation of Feynman–Kac distributions</bodyTitle>
      <p>Monte Carlo methods are numerical methods that are widely used
in situations where
(i) a stochastic (usually Markovian) model is given for some underlying
process, and (ii) some quantity of interest should be evaluated, that
can be expressed in terms of the expected value of a functional of the
process trajectory, which includes as an important special case the
probability that a given event has occurred.
Numerous examples can be found, e.g. in financial engineering (pricing of options and derivative
securities)  <ref xlink:href="#aspi-2016-bid0" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>,
in performance evaluation of communication networks (probability of buffer
overflow), in statistics of hidden Markov models (state estimation,
evaluation of contrast and score functions), etc.
Very often in practice, no analytical expression is available for
the quantity of interest, but it is possible to simulate trajectories
of the underlying process. The idea behind Monte Carlo methods is
to generate independent trajectories of this process
or of an alternate instrumental process,
and to build an approximation (estimator) of the quantity of interest
in terms of the weighted empirical probability distribution
associated with the resulting independent sample.
By the law of large numbers, the above estimator converges
as the size <formula type="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" overflow="scroll"><mi>N</mi></math></formula> of the sample goes to infinity, with rate <formula type="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" overflow="scroll"><mrow><mn>1</mn><mo>/</mo><msqrt><mi>N</mi></msqrt></mrow></math></formula>
and the asymptotic variance can be estimated using an appropriate
central limit theorem.
To reduce the variance of the estimator, many variance
reduction techniques have been proposed.
Still, running independent Monte Carlo simulations can lead to
very poor results, because trajectories are generated <i>blindly</i>,
and only afterwards are the corresponding weights evaluated.
Some of the weights can happen to be negligible, in which case the
corresponding trajectories are not going to contribute to the estimator,
i.e. computing power has been wasted.</p>
      <p>A major breakthrough made in the mid 90's,
has been the introduction of interacting Monte Carlo methods,
also known as sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) methods,
in which a whole (possibly weighted) sample,
called <i>system of particles</i>, is propagated in time, where
the particles</p>
      <simplelist>
        <li id="uid12">
          <p noindent="true"><i>explore</i> the state space under the effect of
a <i>mutation</i> mechanism which mimics the evolution of the
underlying process,</p>
        </li>
        <li id="uid13">
          <p noindent="true">and are <i>replicated</i> or <i>terminated</i>, under
the effect of a <i>selection</i> mechanism which automatically
concentrates the particles, i.e. the available computing power,
into regions of interest of the state space.</p>
        </li>
      </simplelist>
      <p>In full generality, the underlying process is a discrete–time Markov
chain, whose state space can be</p>
      <p rend="quoted">finite,
continuous,
hybrid (continuous / discrete),
graphical,
constrained,
time varying,
pathwise, etc.,</p>
      <p>the only condition being that it can easily be <i>simulated</i>.</p>
      <p>In the special case of particle filtering,
originally developed within the tracking community,
the algorithms yield a numerical approximation of the optimal Bayesian
filter, i.e. of the conditional probability distribution
of the hidden state given the past observations, as a (possibly
weighted) empirical probability distribution of the system of particles.
In its simplest version, introduced in several different scientific
communities under the name of
<i>bootstrap filter</i>  <ref xlink:href="#aspi-2016-bid1" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>,
<i>Monte Carlo filter</i>  <ref xlink:href="#aspi-2016-bid2" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>
or <i>condensation</i> (conditional density propagation)
algorithm  <ref xlink:href="#aspi-2016-bid3" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>,
and which historically has been the first algorithm to include
a resampling step,
the selection mechanism is governed by the likelihood function:
at each time step, a particle is more likely to survive
and to replicate at the next generation if it is consistent with
the current observation.
The algorithms also provide as a by–product a numerical approximation
of the likelihood function, and of many other contrast functions for
parameter estimation in hidden Markov models, such as the prediction
error or the conditional least–squares criterion.</p>

      <p>Particle methods are very easy to implement, since it is sufficient
in principle to simulate independent trajectories of the underlying
process.
The whole problematic is multidisciplinary,
not only because of the already mentioned diversity of the scientific
and engineering areas in which particle methods are used,
but also because of the diversity of the scientific communities
which have contributed to establish the foundations of the field</p>
      <p rend="quoted">target tracking,
interacting particle systems,
empirical processes,
genetic algorithms (GA),
hidden Markov models and nonlinear filtering,
Bayesian statistics,
Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods.</p>
      <p>These algorithms can be interpreted as numerical approximation schemes
for Feynman–Kac distributions, a pathwise generalization of Gibbs–Boltzmann
distributions,
in terms of the weighted empirical probability distribution
associated with a system of particles.
This abstract point of view  <ref xlink:href="#aspi-2016-bid15" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>, <ref xlink:href="#aspi-2016-bid16" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>,
has proved to be extremely fruitful in providing a very general
framework to the design and analysis of numerical approximation schemes,
based on systems of branching and / or interacting particles,
for nonlinear dynamical systems with values in the space of probability
distributions, associated with Feynman–Kac distributions.
Many asymptotic results have been proved as the number <formula type="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" overflow="scroll"><mi>N</mi></math></formula> of
particles (sample size) goes to infinity,

      <p>The estimation of the small probability of a rare but critical event,
is a crucial issue in industrial areas such as</p>
      <p rend="quoted">nuclear power plants,
food industry,
telecommunication networks,
finance and insurance industry,
air traffic management, etc.</p>
      <p>In such complex systems, analytical methods cannot be used, and
naive Monte Carlo methods are clearly unefficient to estimate accurately
very small probabilities.
Besides importance sampling, an alternate widespread technique
consists in multilevel splitting  <ref xlink:href="#aspi-2016-bid23" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>,
where trajectories going towards the
critical set are given offsprings, thus increasing the number of
trajectories that eventually reach the critical set.
As shown in <ref xlink:href="#aspi-2016-bid24" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>, the Feynman–Kac formalism
of <ref xlink:href="#uid11" location="intern" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/> is well suited for the design
and analysis of splitting algorithms for rare event simulation.</p>
      <p><b>Propagation of uncertainty</b>   Multilevel splitting can be used in static situations. Here, the
objective is to learn the probability distribution of an output random
variable <formula type="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" overflow="scroll"><mrow><mi>Y</mi><mo>=</mo><mi>F</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>X</mi><mo>)</mo></mrow></math></formula>, where the function <formula type="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" overflow="scroll"><mi>F</mi></math></formula> is only defined pointwise
for instance by a computer programme, and where the probability distribution
of the input random variable <formula type="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" overflow="scroll"><mi>X</mi></math></formula> is known and easy to simulate from.
More specifically, the objective
could be to compute the probability of the output random variable
exceeding a threshold, or more generally to evaluate the
cumulative distribution function of the output random variable for
different output values.
This problem is characterized by
the lack of an analytical expression for the function, the
computational cost of a single pointwise evaluation of the function,
which means that the number of calls to the function should be limited as
much as possible, and finally the complexity and / or unavailability of the
source code of the computer programme, which makes any modification
very difficult or even impossible, for instance to change the model as in
importance sampling methods.</p>
      <p>The key issue is to learn as fast as possible regions of the input space
which contribute most to the computation of the target quantity. The
proposed splitting methods consists in (i) introducing a sequence of
intermediate regions in the input space, implicitly defined by exceeding
an increasing sequence of thresholds or levels, (ii) counting the fraction
of samples that reach a level given that the previous level has been
reached already, and (iii) improving the diversity of the selected samples,
usually with an artificial Markovian dynamics for the input variable.
In this way, the algorithm learns</p>
      <simplelist>
        <li id="uid15">
          <p noindent="true">the transition probability between successive levels, hence
the probability of reaching each intermediate level,</p>
        </li>
        <li id="uid16">
          <p noindent="true">and the probability distribution of the input random variable,
conditionned on the output variable reaching each intermediate level.</p>
        </li>
      </simplelist>
      <p>A further remark, is that this conditional probability distribution is
precisely the optimal (zero variance) importance distribution needed to
compute the probability of reaching the considered intermediate level.</p>
      <p><b>Rare event simulation</b>   To be specific, consider a complex dynamical system modelled as a Markov
process, whose state can possibly contain continuous components and
finite components (mode, regime, etc.), and the objective is to
compute the probability, hopefully very small, that a critical region
of the state space is reached by the Markov process before a final
time <formula type="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" overflow="scroll"><mi>T</mi></math></formula>, which can be deterministic and fixed, or random (for instance
the time of return to a recurrent set, corresponding to a nominal
behaviour).</p>
      <p>The proposed splitting method consists in (i) introducing a decreasing
sequence of intermediate, more and more critical, regions in the state
space, (ii) counting the fraction of trajectories that reach an
intermediate region before time <formula type="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" overflow="scroll"><mi>T</mi></math></formula>, given that the previous intermediate
region has been reached before time <formula type="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" overflow="scroll"><mi>T</mi></math></formula>, and (iii) regenerating the
population at each stage, through resampling. In addition to the
non–intrusive behaviour of the method, the splitting methods make it
possible to learn the probability distribution of typical critical
trajectories, which reach the critical region before final time <formula type="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" overflow="scroll"><mi>T</mi></math></formula>,
an important feature that methods based on importance sampling usually
miss.

      <p>A related issue is global optimization. Indeed, the difficult problem

can be replaced by the apparently simpler problem of sampling a population
from a probability distribution depending on a small parameter,
and asymptotically supported by the set <formula type="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" overflow="scroll"><mi>M</mi></math></formula> as the small parameter goes
to zero. The usual approach here is to use the cross–entropy

the optimal importance distribution within a prescribed parametric
family. On the other hand, multilevel splitting methods could provide
an alternate nonparametric approach to this problem.</p>

      <bodyTitle>Statistical learning: pattern recognition
and nonparametric regression</bodyTitle>
      <p>In pattern recognition and statistical learning, also known as machine
learning, nearest neighbor (NN) algorithms are amongst the simplest but
also very powerful algorithms available.
Basically, given a training set of data, i.e. an <formula type="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" overflow="scroll"><mi>N</mi></math></formula>–sample of i.i.d. object–feature pairs, with real–valued features,
the question is how to generalize,
that is how to guess the feature associated with any new object.
To achieve this, one chooses some integer <formula type="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" overflow="scroll"><mi>k</mi></math></formula> smaller than <formula type="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" overflow="scroll"><mi>N</mi></math></formula>, and
takes the mean–value of the <formula type="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" overflow="scroll"><mi>k</mi></math></formula> features associated with the <formula type="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" overflow="scroll"><mi>k</mi></math></formula> objects
that are nearest to the new object, for some given metric.</p>
      <p>In general, there is no way to guess exactly the value of the feature
associated with the new object, and the minimal error that can be done
is that of the Bayes estimator, which cannot be computed by lack of knowledge
of the distribution of the object–feature pair, but the Bayes estimator
can be useful to characterize the strength of the method.
So the best that can be expected is that the NN estimator converges, say
when the sample size <formula type="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" overflow="scroll"><mi>N</mi></math></formula> grows, to the Bayes estimator. This is what has been
proved in great generality by Stone  <ref xlink:href="#aspi-2016-bid27" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/> for the mean square
convergence, provided that the object is a finite–dimensional random
variable, the feature is a square–integrable random variable,
and the ratio <formula type="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" overflow="scroll"><mrow><mi>k</mi><mo>/</mo><mi>N</mi></mrow></math></formula> goes to 0.
Nearest neighbor estimator is not the only local averaging estimator with
this property, but it is arguably the simplest.</p>
      <p>The asymptotic behavior when the sample size grows is well understood in
finite dimension, but the situation is radically different in
general infinite dimensional spaces, when the objects to be classified
are functions, images, etc.</p>
      <p><b>Nearest neighbor classification in infinite dimension</b>   In finite dimension, the <formula type="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" overflow="scroll"><mi>k</mi></math></formula>–nearest neighbor classifier
is universally consistent, i.e. its probability of error converges to
the Bayes risk as <formula type="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" overflow="scroll"><mi>N</mi></math></formula> goes to infinity, whatever the joint probability
distribution of the pair, provided that the ratio <formula type="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" overflow="scroll"><mrow><mi>k</mi><mo>/</mo><mi>N</mi></mrow></math></formula> goes to zero.
Unfortunately, this result is no longer valid in general metric spaces,
and the objective is to find out reasonable sufficient conditions for
the weak consistency to hold. Even in finite dimension, there are exotic
distances such that the nearest neighbor does not even get closer (in the
sense of the distance) to the point of interest, and the state space
needs to be complete for the metric, which is the first condition.
Some regularity on the regression function is required next. Clearly,
continuity is too strong because it is not required in finite dimension,
and a weaker form of regularity is assumed. The following consistency
result has been obtained: if the metric space is separable and
if some Besicovich condition holds, then the nearest neighbor classifier
is weakly consistent.
Note that the Besicovich condition is always fulfilled in finite dimensional
vector spaces (this result is called the Besicovich theorem), and that
a counterexample <ref xlink:href="#aspi-2016-bid28" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/> can be given in an infinite
dimensional space with
a Gaussian measure (in this case, the nearest neighbor classifier is clearly
nonconsistent). Finally, a simple example has been found which verifies
the Besicovich condition with a noncontinuous regression function.</p>

of the regression function, based on <formula type="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" overflow="scroll"><mi>N</mi></math></formula> independent copies of the
object–feature pair, have been investigated
when the object is in a suitable ball in some functional space.

can be obtained for the expected squared difference between the <formula type="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" overflow="scroll"><mi>k</mi></math></formula>–nearest
neighbor estimator and the Bayes regression function, in a very general
setting. The results have also been
particularized to classical function spaces such as Sobolev spaces,
Besov spaces and reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces.

particle filtering, has been introduced by the target tracking

      <p>Another application domain of particle methods, or interacting Monte Carlo
methods, that ASPI has decided to focus on is the estimation of the small
probability of a rare but critical event, in complex dynamical systems.
This is a crucial issue in industrial areas such as</p>

food industry,
telecommunication networks,
finance and insurance industry,
air traffic management, etc.</p>
      <p>In such complex systems, analytical methods cannot be used, and naive
Monte Carlo methods are clearly unefficient to estimate accurately
very small probabilities.
Besides importance sampling, an alternate widespread technique
consists in multilevel splitting  <ref xlink:href="#aspi-2016-bid23" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>,
where trajectories going towards the
critical set are given offsprings, thus increasing the number of
trajectories that eventually reach the critical set.
This approach not only makes it possible to estimate the probability of
the rare event, but also provides realizations of the random trajectory,
given that it reaches the critical set, i.e. provides realizations of typical
critical trajectories, an important feature that methods based on importance
sampling usually miss.</p>
      <p>ASPI is contributing (or has contributed recently)
to several applications of multilevel splitting for
rare event simulation, such as risk assessment in air traffic management,

Our approach is based on a "sequential" model (i.e., each high-resolution frame is supposed to be a displaced version of the preceding one) and considers the use of sparsity-enforcing priors. Both the recovery of the high–resolution images and the motion fields relating them is tackled. This leads to a large–dimensional, non-convex and non-smooth problem. We propose an algorithmic framework to address the latter. Our approach relies on fast gradient evaluation methods and modern optimization techniques for non-differentiable/non-convex problems. Unlike some other previous works, we show that there exists a provably-convergent method with a complexity linear in the problem dimensions. We assess the proposed optimization method on several video benchmarks and emphasize its good performance with respect to the state of the art.</p>

      <p>Dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) has emerged as a powerful tool for analyzing the dynamics of non-linear systems from experimental datasets. Recently, several attempts have extended DMD to the context of low-rank approximations. This low-rank extension takes the form of a non–convex optimization problem.
To the best of our knowledge, only sub–optimal algorithms have been proposed in the literature to compute the solution of this problem. In <ref xlink:href="#aspi-2016-bid35" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>, we prove that there exists a closed-form optimal solution to this problem and design an effective algorithm to compute it based on singular value decomposition (SVD). Based on this solution, we then propose efficient procedures for reduced-order modeling and for the identification of the low-rank DMD modes and amplitudes.
Experiments illustrates the gain in performance of the proposed algorithm compared to state-of-the-art techniques.

      <p>Nowadays, ocean and atmosphere sciences face a deluge of data from spatial observations, in situ monitoring as well as numerical simulations. The availability of these different data sources offer new opportunities, still largely underexploited, to improve the understanding, modeling and reconstruction of geophysical dynamics. The classical way to reconstruct the space–time variations of a geophysical system from observations relies on data assimilation methods using multiple runs of the known dynamical model. This classical framework may have severe limitations including its computational cost, the lack of adequacy of the model with observed data, modeling uncertainties. In  <ref xlink:href="#aspi-2016-bid38" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>, we explore an alternative approach and develop a fully data–-driven framework, which combines machine learning and statistical sampling to simulate the dynamics of complex system. As a proof concept, we address the assimilation of the chaotic Lorenz–63 model and imputation of missing data in multisite wind and rain time series.
We demonstrate that a nonparametric sampler from a catalog of historical datasets, namely local linear regression, combined with a classical stochastic data assimilation scheme, the ensemble Kalman filter and the particular filter, reach state–of–the–art performances, without online evaluations of the physical model. The use of local regression instead of analog sampler allows to improve the performance of the filters.</p>

and Laurent Rouvière (université de Haute Bretagne, Rennes).</p>
      <p>Classification and discriminant analysis methods have grown in depths
during the past 20 years. Fisher linear discriminant analysis (LDA) is
the basic but standard approach. As the structure and dimension of the
data becomes more complex in a wide range of applications, such as
functional data, there is a need for more flexible nonparametric
classification and discriminant analysis tools, especially when the
ratio of learning sample size to number of covariates is low and the
covariates are highly correlated and the covariance matrix is highly
degenerated or when the large number of covariates are generally weak
in predicting the class labels. For some data such as spectrometry
data, only some parts of the observed curves are discriminant leading
to groups of variables.</p>
      <p>We proposed a classification tree based on groups of variables. Like
usual tree-based methods, the algorithm partitions the feature space
into M regions, by recursively performing binary splits.
The main difference is that each split is based on groups of variables
and the boundary between both classes is the hyperplane which
minimizes the Bayes risk in the set generated by the selected group of
variables.
We demonstrate on several toy examples and real spectrometry data that
the performances of the proposed tree groups algorithm are at least as
good as the one of the standard CART algorithm and group Lasso
logistic regression.

        <p>The issue here is user localization, and more generally localization–based
services (LBS). This problem is addressed by GPS for outdoor applications,
but no such general solution has been provided so far for indoor applications.
The desired solution should rely on sensors that are already available
on smartphones and other tablet computers.
Inertial solutions that use MEMS (microelectromechanical system, such as
accelerometer, magnetometer, gyroscope and barometer) are already studied
at CEA. An increase in performance should be possible, provided these data
are combined with other available data: map of the building, WiFi signal,
modeling of perturbations of the magnetic field, etc. To be successful,
advanced data fusion techniques should be used, such as particle filtering
and the like, to take into account displacement constraints due to walls
in the building, to manage several possible trajectories, and to deal with
rather heterogeneous information (map, radio signals, sensor signals).</p>
        <p>The main objective of this thesis is to design and tune localization
algorithms that will be tested on platforms already available at CEA.
Special attention is paid to particle smoothing and particle MCMC algorithms,
to exploit some very precise information available at special time instants,
e.g. when the user is clearly localized near a landmark point.</p>
        <p>In some applications, real time estimation of the trajectory is not needed,
and a post processing framework may provide a better estimation of this
trajectory. In <ref xlink:href="#aspi-2016-bid39" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>, we present and compare
three different algorithms to improve a real time trajectory estimation.
Actually, two different smoothing algorithms and the Viterbi algorithm are
implemented and evaluated. These methods improve the regularity of the
estimated trajectory by reducing switches between hypotheses.</p>

        <p>This is a collaboration with Dann Laneuville (DCNS Nantes).</p>
        <p>After the introduction of MHT (multi–hypothesis tracking) techniques
in the nineties, multitarget tracking has recently seen promising
developpments with the introduction of new algorithms such
as the PHD (probability hypothesis density) filter  <ref xlink:href="#aspi-2016-bid40" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>, <ref xlink:href="#aspi-2016-bid41" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>
or the HISP (hypothesised filter for independent stochastic populations)
filter  <ref xlink:href="#aspi-2016-bid42" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>.
These techniques provide a unified multitarget model in a Bayesian
framework  <ref xlink:href="#aspi-2016-bid43" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>,
which makes it possible to design recursive estimators of
a <i>multitarget probability density</i>.
Two main approaches can be used here: sequential Monte Carlo (SMC, also
kown as particle filtering), and Gaussian mixture (GM).
A third approach, based on discretizing the state–space in a possibly
adaptive way, could also be considered despite its larger computational load.
These methods are well studied and provide quite good results
for <i>contact output</i> data, which correspond to regularly spaced
measurements of targets with a large SNR (signal–to–noise ratio).
Here, the data is processed (compared with a detection threshold) in each
resolution cell of the sensor, so as to provide a list of detections at
a given time instant.
Among these methods, the HISP filter has the best performance/computational
cost ratio.</p>
        <p>However, these classical methods are unefficient for targets with a low SNR,
e.g. targets in far range or small targets with a small detection
probability.
For such targets, preprocessing (thresholding) the data is not a good idea,
and a much better idea is to feed a tracking algorithm with the
raw <i>sensor output</i> data directly.
These new methods  <ref xlink:href="#aspi-2016-bid44" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/> require a precise modeling of the
sensor physics and a direct access to the radar (or the sonar) raw data,
i.e. to the signal intensity level in each azimuth/range cell.
Note that these new methods seem well suited to new types of sensors such
as lidar, since manufacturers do not integrate a detection module and do
provide raw images of the signal intensity level in each azimuth/range cell.</p>
        <p>The objective of the thesis is to study and design a tracking algorithm
using raw data, and to implement it on radar (or sonar, or lidar) real data.</p>

        <p>The COSMOS project aims at developing numerical techniques dedicated
to the sampling of high–dimensional probability measures describing a
system of interest. There are two application fields of interest:
computational statistical physics (a field also known as molecular
simulation), and computational statistics. These two fields share some
common history, but it seems that, in view of the quite recent
specialization of the scientists and the techniques used in these
respective fields, the communication between molecular simulation and
computational statistics is not as intense as it should be.</p>
        <p>We believe that there are therefore many opportunities in considering
both fields at the same time: in particular, the adaption of a
successful simulation technique from one field to the other requires
first some abstraction process where the features specific to the
original field of application are discarded and only the heart of the
method is kept. Such a cross–fertilization is however only possible if
the techniques developed in a specific field are sufficiently mature:
this is why some fundamental studies specific to one of the
application fields are still required. Our belief is that the
embedding in a more general framework of specific developments in a
given field will accelerate and facilitate the diffusion to the other
field.</p>

        <p>The GERONIMO project aims at devising new efficient and effective
techniques for the design of geophysical reduced–order models (ROMs)
from image data. The project both arises from the crucial need of
accurate low–order descriptions of highly–complex geophysical
phenomena and the recent numerical revolution which has supplied the
geophysical scientists with an unprecedented volume of image data.
Our research activities are concerned by the exploitation of the huge
amount of information contained in image data in order to reduce the
uncertainty on the unknown parameters of the models and improve the
reduced–model accuracy. In other words, the objective of our
researches to process the large amount of incomplete and noisy image
data daily captured by satellites sensors to devise new advanced model
reduction techniques. The construction of ROMs is placed into a
probabilistic Bayesian inference context, allowing for the handling of
uncertainties associated to image measurements and the
characterization of parameters of the reduced dynamical system.</p>

        <p>With the development of large-scale computing facilities, simulations of materials at the molecular scale are now performed on a daily basis. The aim of these simulations is to understand the macroscopic properties of matter from a microscopic description, for example, its atomistic configuration.</p>
        <p>In order to make these simulations efficient and precise, mathematics have a crucial role to play. Indeed, specific algorithms have to be used in order to bridge the time and space scales between the atomistic level and the macroscopic level. The objective of the MSMath ERC project is thus to develop and study efficient algorithms to simulate high-dimensional systems over very long times. These developments are done in collaboration with physicists, chemists and biologists who are using these numerical methods in an academic or industrial context.</p>
        <p>In particular, we are developping mathematical tools at the interface between the analysis of partial differential equations and stochastic analysis in order to characterize and to quantify the metastability of stochastic processes. Metastability is a fundamental concept to understand the timescale separation between the microscopic model and the macroscopic world. Many algorithms which aim at bridging the timescales are built using this timescale separation.</p>

A significant advantage of adaptive multilevel splitting is its robustness,
since it does not require too much knowledge about the behavior of the
system under study.
An interesting challenge would be to understand how to couple the algorithm
with numerically efficient simulation methods such

This workshop aimed at bringing together a wide range of researchers, practitioners, and graduate students whose work is related to the stochastic modelling of meteorological variables and stochastic weather generators.
Stochastic weather generators give us ability to reliably predict climate-related risks by simulating sequences of daily weather and climate consistent with specific aspects of climate variability and change. The simulated sequences of meteorological variables (rainfall, wind, temperature,etc.) are typically used as inputs into complex environmental and ecosystem models. They have a wide range of applications in hydrology, agriculture and environmental management.</p>
