      <bodyTitle>Presentation and scientific foundations</bodyTitle>
      <p>The research work within the project-team is mostly devoted to the
design and analysis of cryptographic algorithms, in the classical or
in the quantum setting. This work is essential since the current situation of
cryptography is rather fragile. Many
cryptographic protocols are now known whose security can be formally
proved assuming that the involved cryptographic primitives are ideal
(random oracle model, ideal cipher model...). However, the
security of the available primitives has been either threatened by recent progress
in cryptanalysis or by the possible invention of a large quantum
computer. In other
words, there is usually no concrete algorithm available to instantiate
in practice the ideal “black boxes” used in these protocols!</p>
      <p>In this context, our research work focuses on both families of
cryptographic primitives, <i>symmetric</i> and <i>asymmetric</i>
primitives.</p>

      <bodyTitle>Scientific foundations</bodyTitle>
      <p>Our approach relies on a
competence whose impact is much wider than cryptology. Our tools
come from information theory, discrete mathematics, probabilities,
algorithmics, quantum physics... Most of our work mixes fundamental
aspects (study of mathematical objects) and practical aspects
(cryptanalysis, design of algorithms, implementations). Our
research is mainly driven by the belief that discrete mathematics
and algorithmics of finite structures form the scientific core of
(algorithmic) data protection.

    <subsection id="uid10" level="1">
      <bodyTitle>Symmetric cryptology</bodyTitle>
      <p>Symmetric techniques are widely used because they are the only ones that can achieve some major features such as high-speed or low-cost encryption, fast authentication, and efficient hashing. It is a very active research area which is stimulated by a pressing industrial demand.
The process which has led to the new block cipher standard AES in 2001 was the outcome of a decade of research in symmetric cryptography, where new attacks have been proposed, analyzed and then thwarted by some appropriate designs. However, even if its security has not been challenged so far, it clearly appears that the AES cannot serve as a Swiss knife in all environments. In particular an important challenge raised by several new applications is the design of symmetric encryption schemes with some additional properties compared to the AES, either in terms of implementation performance (low-cost hardware implementation, low latency, resistance against side-channel attacks...) or in terms of functionalities (like authenticated encryption). The past decade has then been characterized by a multiplicity of new proposals. This proliferation of symmetric primitives has been amplified by several public competitions (eSTREAM, SHA-3, CAESAR...) which have encouraged innovative constructions and promising but unconventional designs. We are then facing up to a very new situation where implementers need to make informed choices among more than 40 lightweight block ciphers <footnote id="uid11" id-text="1">35 are described on <ref xlink:href="https://www.cryptolux.org/index.php/Lightweight_Block_Ciphers" location="extern" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest">https://<allowbreak/>www.<allowbreak/>cryptolux.<allowbreak/>org/<allowbreak/>index.<allowbreak/>php/<allowbreak/>Lightweight_Block_Ciphers</ref>.</footnote> or 57 new authenticated-encryption schemes <footnote id="uid12" id-text="2">see <ref xlink:href="http://competitions.cr.yp.to/caesar-submissions.html" location="extern" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest">http://<allowbreak/>competitions.<allowbreak/>cr.<allowbreak/>yp.<allowbreak/>to/<allowbreak/>caesar-submissions.<allowbreak/>html</ref></footnote>. Evaluating the security of all these proposals has then become a primordial task which requires the attention of the community.</p>
      <p>In this context we believe that the cryptanalysis effort cannot scale up without an in-depth study of the involved algorithms.
Indeed most attacks are described as ad-hoc techniques dedicated to a particular cipher. To determine whether they apply to some other primitives, it is then crucial to formalize them in a general setting. Our approach relies on the idea that a unified description of generic attacks (in the sense that they apply to a large class of primitives) is the only methodology for a precise evaluation of the resistance of all these new proposals, and of their security margins. In particular, such a work prevents misleading analyses based on wrong estimations of the complexity or on non-optimized algorithms. It also provides security criteria which enable designers to guarantee that their primitive resists some families of attacks. The main challenge is to provide a generic description which captures most possible optimizations of the attack.</p>

    <subsection id="uid13" level="1">
      <bodyTitle>Code-based cryptography</bodyTitle>
      <p>Public-key cryptography is one of the key tools for providing network
security (SSL, e-commerce, e-banking...). The security of nearly
all public-key schemes used today relies on the presumed difficulty of
two problems, namely factorization of large integers or computing the
discrete logarithm over various groups. The hardness of those
problems was questioned in 1994 <footnote id="uid14" id-text="3">P. Shor, <i>Algorithms for
quantum computation: Discrete logarithms and factoring</i>, FOCS
1994.</footnote> when Shor showed that a quantum computer could solve them
efficiently. Though large enough quantum computers that would be able
to threaten the existing cryptosystems do not exist yet, the
cryptographic research community has to get ready and has to prepare
alternatives. This line of work is usually referred to as <i>post-quantum cryptography</i>. This has become a prominent research field. Most notably, an international call for post-quantum primitives <footnote id="uid15" id-text="4"><ref xlink:href="http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/ST/post-quantum-crypto/" location="extern" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest">http://<allowbreak/>csrc.<allowbreak/>nist.<allowbreak/>gov/<allowbreak/>groups/<allowbreak/>ST/<allowbreak/>post-quantum-crypto/</ref></footnote> has been launched by the NIST very recently, with a submission deadline in November 2017.</p>
      <p>The research of the project-team in this field is
focused on the design and cryptanalysis of cryptosystems making use of
coding theory. Code-based cryptography is one the main techniques for post-quantum
cryptography (together with lattice-based, multivariate, or hash-based
cryptography).

          <p noindent="true">quantum computing, that offers the promise of solving some problems that seem to be intractable for

        <li id="uid18">
          <p noindent="true">quantum cryptography, which provides new ways to exchange data in a provably secure fashion.
For instance it allows key distribution by using an authenticated channel and quantum communication over an

the laws of quantum physics, even with all-powerful adversaries.</p>
        </li>
      </descriptionlist>
      <p>Our team deals with quantum coding theoretic issues related to building a large quantum
computer and with quantum cryptography. The first part builds upon our expertise
in classical coding theory whereas the second axis focuses on
obtaining security proofs for quantum protocols or on devising quantum cryptographic protocols
(and more generally quantum protocols related to cryptography).
A close relationship with partners working in the whole area of quantum information processing
in the Parisian region has also been developed through our participation
to the Fédération de Recherche “PCQC” (Paris Centre for Quantum Computing).

    <subsection id="uid20" level="1">
      <bodyTitle>Cryptographic primitives</bodyTitle>
      <p>Our major application domain is the design of cryptographic primitives, especially for platforms with restricting implementation requirements. For instance, we aim at recommending (or designing) low-cost (or extremely fast) encryption schemes, or primitives which remain secure against quantum computers. </p>
    </subsection>
    <subsection id="uid21" level="1">
      <bodyTitle>Code Reconstruction</bodyTitle>
      <p>To evaluate the quality of a cryptographic algorithm, it is usually
assumed that its specifications are public, as, in accordance with
Kerckhoffs principle, it would be dangerous to rely, even partially,
on the fact that the adversary does not know those specifications.
However, this fundamental rule does not mean that the specifications
are known to the attacker. In practice, before mounting a
cryptanalysis, it is necessary to strip off the data. This
reverse-engineering process is often subtle, even when the data
formatting is not concealed on purpose. A typical case is
interception: some raw data, not necessarily encrypted, is observed
out of a noisy channel. To access the information, the whole
communication system has first to be disassembled and every
constituent reconstructed. A transmission system actually corresponds
to a succession of elements (symbol mapping, scrambler, channel
encoder, interleaver... ), and there exist many possibilities
for each of them.
In addition to the “preliminary to cryptanalysis” aspect, there are
other links between those problems and cryptology. They share
some scientific tools (algorithmics, discrete mathematics,
probability...), but beyond that, there are some very strong
similarities in the techniques.</p>

        <bodyTitle>Post-quantum symmetric cryptanalysis</bodyTitle>
        <p>We have been considering the problem of symmetric cryptography in the future environment that will see the arrival of quantum computers. Indeed, this environment will pose a real problem for the majority of asymmetric primitives, but little is known about the implications for the security of symmetric primitives. Confidence in our symmetric primitives is entirely based on our knowledge within the field of cryptanalysis, but in reality, we do not know much about the symmetric post-quantum attacks. If we want post-quantum systems to be reliable and efficient, we need to understand how adversaries might exploit this new computing power. This year, two preliminary results have been obtained within the team and published at CRYPTO 2016 <ref xlink:href="#secret-2016-bid0" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/> and in the <i>IACR Transactions on Symmetric Cryptology</i> <ref xlink:href="#secret-2016-bid1" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>. They include surprising results demonstrating that, in some scenarios, some symmetric systems can also become vulnerable to the quantum computer. Recently María Naya-Plasencia has been awarded an ERC starting grant, QUASYModo, to work on this subject. This grant will enable us to continue this work in more depth.</p>

        <bodyTitle>Real-word impact of some theoretical cryptanalytic works</bodyTitle>
        <p>Weak cryptography can be used long after weaknesses have been found by
the academic community. For instance, Rogaway warned that the
predictable IV used in TLS was a problem in 2002, but it took a public
demonstration with a practical exploit in 2011 (the BEAST attack) for
servers and clients to implement countermeasures. The same happened with the use of compression (CRIME), unsecure version fallback (POODLE), and known biases in RC4 (RC4NOMORE), to name a few examples.
In joint works at NDSS and ACM CCS, K. Bhargavan from the PROSECCO project-team and G. Leurent showed two almost practical attacks against deprecated cryptographic primitives that are still used in real-world applications. The SLOTH attack targeted the use of MD5 in TLS for in-protocol signatures, and the Sweet32 attack targeted the use of 64-bit block ciphers: Blowfish in OpenVPN, and 3DES in TLS. Moreover, the SLOTH attack received a distinguished paper award at NDSS.</p>

      <subsection id="uid26" level="2">
        <bodyTitle>Symmetric ciphers for homomorphic encryption schemes</bodyTitle>
        <p>In order to avoid the (extremely) high expansion rate of homomorphic encryption, a solution consists in transmitting to the server the ciphertext <formula type="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" overflow="scroll"><mi>c</mi></math></formula> obtained by encrypting <formula type="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" overflow="scroll"><mi>m</mi></math></formula> with a symmetric scheme (the corresponding secret key encrypted by the homomorphic cipher is also transmitted).

      <p>Reference implementation of parallel CFS (reinforced version of the digital signature scheme CFS). Two variants are proposed, one with a « bit-packing » finite field arithmetic and an evolution with a « bit-slicing » finite-field arithmetic (collaboration with Peter Schwabe). For 80 bits of security the running time for producing one signature with the « bit-packing » variant is slightly above one second. This is high but was still the fastest so far. The evolution with the « bit-slicing » arithmetic produces the same signature in about 100 milliseconds.</p>

        <bodyTitle>Authenticated encryption and MACs</bodyTitle>
        <p>A limitation of all classical block ciphers is that they aim at protecting confidentiality only, while most applications need both encryption and authentication. These two functionalities are provided by using a block cipher like the AES together with an appropriate mode of operation. However, it appears that the most widely-used mode of operation for authenticated encryption, AES-GCM, is not very efficient for high-speed networks. Also, the security of the GCM mode completely collapses when an IV is reused. These severe drawbacks have then motivated an international competition named CAESAR, partly supported by the NIST, which has been recently launched in order to define some new authenticated encryption schemes <footnote id="uid49" id-text="5"><ref xlink:href="http://competitions.cr.yp.to/caesar.html" location="extern" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest">http://<allowbreak/>competitions.<allowbreak/>cr.<allowbreak/>yp.<allowbreak/>to/<allowbreak/>caesar.<allowbreak/>html</ref></footnote>.

building blocks</bodyTitle>
        <p>The construction of building blocks which guarantee
a high resistance against the known attacks is a major topic within
our project-team, for stream ciphers, block ciphers and hash
functions. The use of such optimal objects actually leads to some
mathematical structures which may be at the origin of new attacks. This
work involves fundamental aspects related to discrete mathematics,
cryptanalysis and implementation aspects. Actually, characterizing
the structures of the building blocks which are optimal regarding to
some attacks is very important for finding appropriate constructions
and also for determining whether the underlying structure induces some
weaknesses or not.
For these reasons, we have investigated several families of filtering
functions and of S-boxes which are well-suited for their cryptographic
properties or for their implementation characteristics.</p>

      <p>The first cryptosystem based on error-correcting codes
was a public-key encryption scheme proposed by McEliece in 1978; a
dual variant was proposed in 1986 by Niederreiter. We proposed
the first (and only) digital signature scheme in 2001. Those systems
enjoy very interesting features (fast encryption/decryption, short
signature, good security reduction) but also have their drawbacks
(large public key, encryption overhead, expensive signature
generation). Some of the main issues in this field are</p>

        <p>Protecting quantum information from external noise is an issue of paramount
importance for building a quantum computer. It also worthwhile to
notice that all quantum error-correcting code schemes proposed up to
now suffer from the very same problem that the first (classical)
error-correcting codes had: there are constructions of good quantum
codes, but for the best of them it is not known how to decode them in
polynomial time.</p>
        <p>Two PhD theses started in September 2016 on this topic. First, Antoine Grospellier, co-advised by A. Leverrier and O. Fawzi (Ens Lyon), will study efficient decoding algorithms for quantum LDPC codes. Beyond their intrinsic interest for channel coding problems, such algorithms would be particularly relevant in the context of quantum fault-tolerance, since they would allow to considerably reduce the required overhead to obtain fault-tolerance in quantum computation.
Vivien Londe is co-advised by A. Leverrier and G. Zémor (IMB) and his thesis is devoted to the design of better quantum LDPC codes: the main idea is to generalize the celebrated toric code of Kitaev by considering cellulations of manifolds in higher dimensions. A recent surprising result was that this approach leads to a much better behaviour than naively expected and a major challenge is to explore the mathematics behind this phenomenon in order to find even better constructions, or to uncover potential obstructions.</p>

        <bodyTitle>Relativistic cryptography</bodyTitle>
        <p>Two-party cryptographic tasks are well-known to be impossible without complexity assumptions, either in the classical or the quantum world. Remarkably, such no-go theorems become invalid when adding the physical assumption that no information can travel faster than the speed of light. This additional assumption gives rise to the emerging field of relativistic cryptography. We recently started investigating such questions through the task of bit commitment. In a paper in <i>Physical Review Letters</i> in 2015, K. Chakraborty, A. Chailloux and A. Leverrier developed a security proof for a simple and easily implementable protocol that can achieve arbitrarily long commitment times, thereby establishing that relativistic cryptography is a very practical solution.</p>

        <p>Symmetric cryptography seems at first sight much less affected in the post-quantum world than asymmetric cryptography: its main known threat is Grover's algorithm, which allows for an exhaustive key search in the square root of the normal complexity. For this reason, it is usually believed that doubling key lengths suffices to maintain an equivalent security in the post-quantum world.
However, a lot of work is certainly required in the field of symmetric cryptography in order to “quantize” the classical families of attacks in an
optimized way. M. Naya Plasencia has recently been awarded an ERC Starting grant for her project named QUASYModo on this topic.</p>

As a first application, the most widely used modes of operation for authentication and authenticated encryption (e.g. CBC-MAC, PMAC, GMAC, GCM, and OCB) are completely broken in this security model. These quantum attacks are also applicable to many CAESAR candidates: CLOC, AEZ, COPA, OTR, POET, OMD, and Minalpher. Second, Simon's algorithm can also be applied to slide attacks, leading to an exponential speed-up of a classical symmetric cryptanalysis technique in the quantum model.</p>

We plan to evaluate carefully the security of the most promising candidates to the Caesar competition, by trying to attack the
underlying primitives or to build security proofs of modes of operation. We target the traditional

              <p noindent="true">Online banking, e-commerce, telemedicine, mobile communication, and cloud computing depend fundamentally on the security of the underlying cryptographic algorithms. Public-key algorithms are particularly crucial since they provide digital signatures and establish secure communication without requiring in-person meetings. Essentially all applications today are based on RSA or on the discrete-logarithm problem in finite fields or on elliptic curves. Cryptographers optimize parameter choices and implementation details for these systems and build protocols on top of these systems; cryptanalysts fine-tune attacks and establish exact security levels for these systems. Alternative systems are far less visible in research and unheard of in practice. It might seem that having three systems offers enough variation, but these systems are all broken as soon as large quantum computers are built. The EU and governments around the world are investing heavily in building quantum computers; society needs to be prepared for the consequences, including cryptanalytic attacks accelerated by these computers. Long-term confidential documents such as patient health-care records and state secrets have to guarantee security for many years, but information encrypted today using RSA or elliptic curves and stored until quantum computers are available will then be as easy to decipher as Enigma-encrypted messages are today. PQCRYPTO will allow users to switch to post-quantum cryptography: cryptographic systems that are not merely secure for today but that will also remain secure long-term against attacks by quantum computers. PQCRYPTO will design a portfolio of high-security post-quantum public-key systems, and will improve the speed of these systems, adapting to the different performance challenges of mobile devices, the cloud, and the Internet of Things. PQCRYPTO will provide efficient implementations of high-security post-quantum cryptography for a broad spectrum of real-world applications.</p>

              <p noindent="true">Today's cryptology offers important challenges. Some are well-known: Can we understand existing cryptanalysis techniques well enough to devise criterion for the design of efficient and secure symmetric cryptographic primitives? Can we propose cryptographic protocols which offer provable security features under some reasonable algorithmic assumptions? Some are newer: How could we overcome the possible apparition of a quantum computer with its devastating consequences on public key cryptography as it is used today? Those challenges must be addressed, and some of the answers will involve tools borrowed to discrete mathematics, combinatorics, algebraic coding theory, algorithmic. The guideline of this proposal is to explore further and enrich the already well established connections between those scientific domains and their applications to cryptography and its challenges.</p>
