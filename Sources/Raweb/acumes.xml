      <bodyTitle>Overall Objectives</bodyTitle>
      <p>ACUMES aims at developing a rigorous framework for numerical simulations and optimal control for transportation and buildings,
with focus on multi-scale, heterogeneous, unsteady phenomena subject to uncertainty.
Starting from established macroscopic
Partial Differential Equation (PDE) models,
we pursue a set of innovative approaches to include small-scale phenomena, which impact the whole system.
Targeting applications contributing to sustainability of urban environments, we couple the resulting models with robust control and optimization techniques.</p>
      <p spacebefore="6.0pt">Modern engineering sciences make an important use of mathematical models and numerical simulations at the conception stage.
Effective models and efficient numerical tools allow for optimization before production and to avoid the construction of expensive prototypes
or costly post-process adjustments.
Most up-to-date modeling techniques aim at helping engineers to increase performances and safety and reduce costs and pollutant emissions
of their products. For example, mathematical traffic flow models are used by civil engineers
to test new management strategies in order
to reduce congestion on the existing road networks and improve crowd evacuation from buildings or other confined spaces
without constructing new infrastructures.
Similar models are also used in mechanical engineering, in conjunction with concurrent optimization methods, to reduce energy consumption, noise and pollutant emissions of cars,
or to increase thermal and structural efficiency of buildings while, in both cases, reducing ecological costs.</p>
      <p spacebefore="6.0pt">Nevertheless, current models and numerical methods exhibit some limitations:</p>
      <simplelist>
        <li id="uid4">
          <p noindent="true">Most simulation-based design procedures used in engineering still rely on steady (time-averaged) state models. Significant improvements have already been obtained with such a modeling level, for instance by optimizing car shapes, but finer models taking into account unsteady phenomena are required in the design phase for further improvements.</p>
        </li>
        <li id="uid5">
          <p noindent="true">The classical purely macroscopic approach, while offering a framework
with a sound analytical basis, performing numerical techniques and good modeling features to some extent,
is not able to reproduce some particular phenomena related to specific
interactions occurring at lower (possibly micro) level.
We refer for example to self-organizing phenomena observed
in pedestrian flows, or to the dynamics of turbulent flows for which large scale / small scale vortical structures interfere.
These flow characteristics need to be taken into account to obtain more precise models and improved optimal solutions.</p>
        </li>
        <li id="uid6">
          <p noindent="true">Uncertainty related to operational conditions (e.g. inflow velocity in aerodynamics), or models (e.g. individual behavior in crowds) is still rarely considered in engineering analysis and design, yielding solutions of poor robustness.</p>
        </li>
      </simplelist>
      <p spacebefore="6.0pt">This project focuses on the analysis and optimal control of classical and non-classical evolutionary systems of Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) arising
in the modeling and optimization of engineering problems related to safety and sustainability of urban environments, mostly involving fluid-dynamics and structural mechanics.
The complexity of the involved dynamical systems
is expressed by multi-scale, time-dependent phenomena, possibly subject to uncertainty, which can hardly be tackled using classical approaches, and require
the development of unconventional techniques.</p>

      <bodyTitle>Research directions</bodyTitle>
      <p>The project develops along the following two axes:</p>
      <simplelist>
        <li id="uid9">
          <p noindent="true">modeling complex systems through novel (unconventional) PDE systems, accounting for multi-scale phenomena and uncertainty;</p>
        </li>
        <li id="uid10">
          <p noindent="true">optimization and optimal control algorithms for systems governed by the above PDE systems.</p>
        </li>
      </simplelist>
      <p>These themes are motivated by the specific problems treated in the applications,
and represent important and up-to-date issues in engineering sciences.
For example, improving the design of transportation means and civil buildings, and the control of traffic flows,
would result not only in better performances of the object of the optimization strategy (vehicles, buildings or road networks level of service),
but also in enhanced safety and lower energy consumption, contributing to reduce costs and pollutant emissions.</p>
      <subsection id="uid11" level="2">
        <bodyTitle>PDE models accounting for multi-scale phenomena and uncertainties</bodyTitle>
        <p>Dynamical models consisting of evolutionary PDEs, mainly of hyperbolic type, appear classically in the applications
studied by the previous Project-Team Opale (compressible flows, traffic, cell-dynamics, medicine, etc). Yet, the classical purely macroscopic approach
is not able to account for some particular phenomena related to specific
interactions occurring at smaller scales.
These phenomena can be of greater importance when dealing with particular applications, where the "first order" approximation
given by the purely macroscopic approach reveals to be inadequate.
We refer for example to self-organizing phenomena observed
in pedestrian flows  <ref xlink:href="#acumes-2016-bid0" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>, or to the dynamics of turbulent flows for which large scale / small scale vortical structures interfere  <ref xlink:href="#acumes-2016-bid1" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, macroscopic models offer well known advantages, namely a sound analytical framework, fast numerical schemes,
the presence of a low number of parameters to be calibrated, and efficient optimization procedures.
Therefore, we are convinced of the interest of keeping this point of view as dominant,
while completing the models with information on the dynamics at the
small scale / microscopic level.
This can be achieved through several techniques, like hybrid models, homogenization, mean field games.
In this project, we will focus on the aspects detailed below.</p>
        <p>The development of adapted and efficient numerical schemes is a mandatory completion, and sometimes ingredient,
of all the approaches listed below.
The numerical schemes developed by the team are based on finite volumes or finite elements techniques,
and constitute an important tool in the study of the considered models, providing a necessary
step towards the design and implementation of the corresponding optimization algorithms, see Section <ref xlink:href="#uid17" location="intern" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>.</p>
        <subsection id="uid12" level="3">
          <bodyTitle>Micro-macro couplings</bodyTitle>
          <p>Modeling of complex problems with a dominant macroscopic point of view often requires
couplings with small scale descriptions.
Accounting for systems heterogeneity or different degrees of accuracy
usually leads to coupled PDE-ODE systems.</p>
          <p>In the case of heterogeneous problems the coupling is "intrinsic",
i.e. the two models evolve together and mutually affect each-other.
For example, accounting for the impact of a large and slow
vehicle (like a bus or a truck) on traffic flow leads to a strongly coupled system consisting of
a (system of) conservation law(s) coupled with an ODE describing the bus trajectory, which acts as a moving bottleneck.The coupling is realized through a local unilateral moving constraint on the flow at the bus location, see  <ref xlink:href="#acumes-2016-bid2" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>
for an existence result and  <ref xlink:href="#acumes-2016-bid3" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>, <ref xlink:href="#acumes-2016-bid4" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/> for numerical schemes.</p>
          <p>If the coupling is intended to offer higher degree of accuracy at some locations, a macroscopic and a microscopic model are connected through an
artificial boundary, and exchange information across it through suitable boundary conditions.
See  <ref xlink:href="#acumes-2016-bid5" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>, <ref xlink:href="#acumes-2016-bid6" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/> for some applications in traffic flow modelling, and  <ref xlink:href="#acumes-2016-bid7" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>, <ref xlink:href="#acumes-2016-bid8" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>, <ref xlink:href="#acumes-2016-bid9" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/> for applications to cell dynamics.</p>
          <p>The corresponding numerical schemes are usually based on classical finite volume or finite element methods for the PDE,
and Euler or Runge-Kutta schemes for the ODE, coupled in order to take into account the interaction fronts.
In particular, the dynamics of the coupling boundaries require an accurate handling capturing the possible presence of non-classical shocks and
preventing diffusion, which could produce wrong solutions, see for example <ref xlink:href="#acumes-2016-bid3" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>, <ref xlink:href="#acumes-2016-bid4" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>.</p>
          <p>We plan to pursue our activity in this framework, also extending the above mentioned approaches to problems in two or higher space dimensions,
to cover applications to crowd dynamics or fluid-structure interaction.</p>
        </subsection>
        <subsection id="uid13" level="3">
          <bodyTitle>Micro-macro limits</bodyTitle>
          <p>Rigorous derivation of macroscopic models from microscopic ones offers a sound basis for the proposed modeling approach, and can
provide alternative numerical schemes, see for example  <ref xlink:href="#acumes-2016-bid10" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>, <ref xlink:href="#acumes-2016-bid11" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/> for the derivation of Lighthill-Whitham-Richards  <ref xlink:href="#acumes-2016-bid12" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>, <ref xlink:href="#acumes-2016-bid13" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/> traffic flow model from Follow-the-Leader and  <ref xlink:href="#acumes-2016-bid14" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/> for results on crowd motion models (see also
<ref xlink:href="#acumes-2016-bid15" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>).
To tackle this aspect, we will rely mainly on two (interconnected) concepts: measure-valued solutions and mean-field limits.</p>
          <p>The notion of <b>measure-valued solutions</b> for conservation laws was first introduced by DiPerna <ref xlink:href="#acumes-2016-bid16" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>, and extensively used since then
to prove convergence of approximate solutions and deduce existence results, see for example  <ref xlink:href="#acumes-2016-bid17" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/> and references therein.
Measure-valued functions have been recently advocated as the appropriate notion of solution
to tackle problems for which
analytical results (such as existence and uniqueness of weak solutions in distributional sense) and numerical convergence are missing  <ref xlink:href="#acumes-2016-bid18" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>, <ref xlink:href="#acumes-2016-bid19" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>.
We refer, for example,
to the notion of solution for non-hyperbolic systems  <ref xlink:href="#acumes-2016-bid20" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>, for which no general theoretical result is available at present,
and to the convergence of finite volume schemes for systems of hyperbolic conservation laws in several space dimensions, see  <ref xlink:href="#acumes-2016-bid19" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>.</p>
          <p>In this framework, we plan to investigate and make use of measure-based PDE models for vehicular and pedestrian traffic flows.
Indeed, a modeling approach based on (multi-scale) time-evolving measures (expressing the agents probability distribution in space)
has been recently introduced (see the monograph  <ref xlink:href="#acumes-2016-bid21" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>),
and proved to be successful for studying emerging self-organised flow patterns  <ref xlink:href="#acumes-2016-bid22" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>.
The theoretical measure framework proves to be also relevant in addressing micro-macro limiting procedures
of mean field type  <ref xlink:href="#acumes-2016-bid23" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>, where one lets the number of agents going to infinity, while keeping the
total mass constant. In this case, one must prove that the <i>empirical measure</i>, corresponding to the sum of Dirac measures concentrated at the agents positions, converges to a measure-valued solution of the corresponding
macroscopic evolution equation.
We recall that a key ingredient in this approach is the use of the <i>Wasserstein distances</i>  <ref xlink:href="#acumes-2016-bid24" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>, <ref xlink:href="#acumes-2016-bid25" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>.
Indeed, as observed in <ref xlink:href="#acumes-2016-bid26" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest">Section 6</ref>, the usual <formula type="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" overflow="scroll"><msup><mi>L</mi><mn>1</mn></msup></math></formula> spaces are not natural in this context, since they don't guarantee uniqueness
of solutions.</p>
          <p>This procedure can potentially be extended to more complex configurations, like for example road networks or
different classes of interacting agents, or to other application domains, like cell-dynamics.</p>
          <p spacebefore="3.0pt">Another powerful tool we shall consider to deal with micro-macro limits is the so-called <b>Mean Field Games (MFG)</b>
technique (see the seminal paper  <ref xlink:href="#acumes-2016-bid27" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>).
This approach has been recently applied to some of the systems studied by the team, such as traffic flow and cell dynamics.
In the context of crowd dynamics, including the case of several populations with different targets, the mean field game approach has been adopted in  <ref xlink:href="#acumes-2016-bid28" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>, <ref xlink:href="#acumes-2016-bid29" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>, <ref xlink:href="#acumes-2016-bid30" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>, <ref xlink:href="#acumes-2016-bid31" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>, under the assumption
that the individual behavior evolves according to a stochastic process, which gives rise to parabolic equations greatly simplifying the analysis of the system.
Besides, a deterministic context is studied in  <ref xlink:href="#acumes-2016-bid32" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>, which considers a non-local velocity field.
For cell dynamics, in order to take into account the fast processes that occur in the migration-related machinery, a framework such the one developed in   <ref xlink:href="#acumes-2016-bid33" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/> to handle games "where agents evolve their strategies according to the best-reply scheme on a much faster time scale than their social configuration variables" may turn out to be suitable. An alternative framework to MFG is also considered. This framework is based on the formulation of -Nash- games constrained by the <b>Fokker-Planck</b> (FP, <ref xlink:href="#acumes-2016-bid34" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>) partial differential equations that govern the time evolution of the probability density functions -PDF- of stochastic systems and on objectives that may require to follow a given PDF trajectory or to minimize an expectation functional.</p>

In particular, equations with non-local flux have been recently introduced in traffic flow modeling
to account for the reaction of drivers or pedestrians to the surrounding density of other individuals, see <ref xlink:href="#acumes-2016-bid42" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>, <ref xlink:href="#acumes-2016-bid43" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>

While pedestrians are likely to react to the presence of people all around them,
drivers will mainly adapt their velocity to the downstream traffic, assigning a greater importance to
closer vehicles. In particular, and in contrast to classical (without integral terms) macroscopic equations,
these models are able to display finite acceleration of vehicles through Lipschitz bounds on the mean velocity <ref xlink:href="#acumes-2016-bid42" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>, <ref xlink:href="#acumes-2016-bid43" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>

          <bodyTitle>Uncertainty in parameters and initial-boundary data</bodyTitle>
          <p>Different sources of uncertainty can be identified in PDE models, related to the fact that the problem of interest is not perfectly known. At first, initial and boundary condition values can be uncertain. For instance, in traffic flows, the time-dependent value of inlet and outlet fluxes, as well as the initial distribution of vehicles density, are not perfectly determined  <ref xlink:href="#acumes-2016-bid53" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>. In aerodynamics, inflow conditions like velocity modulus and direction, are subject to fluctuations   <ref xlink:href="#acumes-2016-bid54" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>, <ref xlink:href="#acumes-2016-bid55" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>. For some engineering problems, the geometry of the boundary can also be uncertain, due to structural deformation, mechanical wear or disregard of some details  <ref xlink:href="#acumes-2016-bid56" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>.
Another source of uncertainty is related to the value of some parameters in the PDE models. This is typically the case of parameters in turbulence models in fluid mechanics, which have been calibrated according to some reference flows but are not universal  <ref xlink:href="#acumes-2016-bid57" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>, <ref xlink:href="#acumes-2016-bid58" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>, or in traffic flow models, which may depend
on the type of road, weather conditions, or even the country of interest (due to differences in driving rules and conductors behaviour).
This leads to equations with flux functions depending on random parameters <ref xlink:href="#acumes-2016-bid59" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>, <ref xlink:href="#acumes-2016-bid60" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>, for which the mean and the variance of the solutions
can be computed using different techniques.
Indeed,
uncertainty quantification for systems governed by PDEs has become a very active research topic in the last years. Most approaches are embedded in a probabilistic framework and aim at quantifying statistical moments of the PDE solutions, under the assumption that the characteristics of uncertain parameters are known. Note that
classical Monte-Carlo approaches exhibit low convergence rate and consequently accurate simulations require huge computational times.
In this respect, some enhanced algorithms have been proposed, for example in the balance law framework <ref xlink:href="#acumes-2016-bid61" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>.
Different approaches propose to modify the PDE solvers to account for this probabilistic context, for instance by defining the non-deterministic part of the solution on an orthogonal basis (Polynomial Chaos decomposition) and using a Galerkin projection  <ref xlink:href="#acumes-2016-bid54" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>, <ref xlink:href="#acumes-2016-bid62" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>, <ref xlink:href="#acumes-2016-bid63" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>, <ref xlink:href="#acumes-2016-bid64" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>
or an entropy closure method  <ref xlink:href="#acumes-2016-bid65" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>, or by discretizing the probability space and extending the numerical schemes to the stochastic components  <ref xlink:href="#acumes-2016-bid66" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>. Alternatively, some other approaches maintain a fully deterministic PDE resolution, but approximate the solution in the vicinity of the reference parameter values by Taylor series expansions based on first- or second-order sensitivities  <ref xlink:href="#acumes-2016-bid67" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>, <ref xlink:href="#acumes-2016-bid58" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>, <ref xlink:href="#acumes-2016-bid68" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>.</p>
          <p>Our objective regarding this topic is twofold. In a pure modeling perspective, we aim at including uncertainty quantification in models calibration and validation for predictive use. In this case, the choice of the techniques will depend on the specific problem considered <ref xlink:href="#acumes-2016-bid69" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>.
Besides, we plan to extend previous works on sensitivity analysis  <ref xlink:href="#acumes-2016-bid56" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>, <ref xlink:href="#acumes-2016-bid70" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/> to more complex and more demanding problems. In particular, high-order Taylor expansions of the solution (greater than two) will be considered in the framework of the Sensitivity Equation Method  <ref xlink:href="#acumes-2016-bid71" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/> (SEM) for unsteady aerodynamic applications, to improve the accuracy of mean and variance estimations.
A second targeted topic in this context is the study of the uncertainty related to turbulence closure parameters, in the sequel of  <ref xlink:href="#acumes-2016-bid58" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>. We aim at exploring the capability of the SEM approach to detect a change of flow topology, in case of detached flows. Our ambition is to contribute to the emergence of a new generation of simulation tools, which will provide solution densities rather than values, to tackle real-life uncertain problems.
This task will also include a reflection about numerical schemes used to solve PDE systems, in the perspective of constructing a unified numerical framework able to account for exact geometries (isogeometric methods), uncertainty propagation and sensitivity analysis w.r.t. control parameters.</p>

          <p>Adjoint methods (achieved at continuous or discrete level) are now commonly used in industry for steady PDE problems.
Our recent developments <ref xlink:href="#acumes-2016-bid72" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/> have shown that the (discrete) adjoint method can be efficiently applied to cost gradient computations
for time-evolving traffic flow on networks, thanks to the special structure of the associated linear systems and the underlying one dimensionality of the problem.
However, this strategy is questionable for more complex (e.g. 2D/3D) unsteady problems,
because it requires sophisticated and time-consuming check-pointing and/or re-computing strategies  <ref xlink:href="#acumes-2016-bid73" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>, <ref xlink:href="#acumes-2016-bid74" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/> for the backward time integration of the adjoint variables. The sensitivity equation method (SEM) offers a promising
alternative  <ref xlink:href="#acumes-2016-bid75" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>, <ref xlink:href="#acumes-2016-bid76" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>, if the number of design parameters is moderate.

          <p noindent="true">Regarding this topic, we intend to apply the continuous sensitivity equation method to challenging problems. In particular, in aerodynamics, multi-scale turbulence models like Large-Eddy Simulation (LES)  <ref xlink:href="#acumes-2016-bid1" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/> , Detached-Eddy Simulation (DES)  <ref xlink:href="#acumes-2016-bid77" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/> or Organized-Eddy Simulation (OES)  <ref xlink:href="#acumes-2016-bid78" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>, are more and more employed to analyse the unsteady dynamics of the flows around bluff-bodies, because they have the ability to compute the interactions of vortices at different scales, contrary to classical Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes models. However, their use in design optimization is tedious, due to the long time integration required. In collaboration with turbulence specialists (M. Braza, CNRS - IMFT), we aim at developing numerical methods for effective sensitivity analysis in this context, and apply them to realistic problems, like the optimization of active flow control devices.
Note that the use of SEM allows computing cost functional gradients at any time, which permits to construct new gradient-based optimization strategies like instantaneous-feedback method  <ref xlink:href="#acumes-2016-bid79" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/> or multiobjective optimization algorithm (see section below).</p>

          <p>n differentiable optimization, multi-disciplinary, multi-point, unsteady optimization or robust-design can all be formulated as
multi-objective optimization problems. In this area, we have proposed the <i>Multiple-Gradient Descent Algorithm (MGDA)</i>
to handle all criteria concurrently <ref xlink:href="#acumes-2016-bid80" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/> <ref xlink:href="#acumes-2016-bid81" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>.
Originally, we have stated a principle according which,
given a family of local gradients, a descent direction common to all considered
objective-functions simultaneously is identified, assuming the Pareto-stationarity condition is not satisfied.
When the family is linearly-independent, we dispose of a direct algorithm.
Inversely, when the family is linearly-dependent, a quadratic-programming problem should be solved.
Hence, the technical difficulty is mostly conditioned by the number <formula type="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" overflow="scroll"><mi>m</mi></math></formula> of objective functions
relative to the search space dimension <formula type="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" overflow="scroll"><mi>n</mi></math></formula>.

at large.</p>
          <p>Moreover, we intend to develop and test a new methodology for robust design that will include uncertainty effects.
More precisely, we propose to employ MGDA
to achieve an effective improvement of all criteria simultaneously, which can be of statistical nature or discrete functional values evaluated in confidence intervals of parameters.

Posterior distributions provided by the Gaussian process are used to design acquisition functions that guide sequential search strategies that balance between exploration and exploitation. Such approaches have been transposed to frameworks other than optimization, such as uncertainty quantification.

      <p>The reduction of CO2 emissions represents a great challenge for the automotive and aeronautic industries, which committed respectively a decrease of 20% for 2020 and 75% for 2050. This goal will not be reachable, unless a significant improvement of the aerodynamic performance of cars and aircrafts is achieved (e.g. aerodynamic resistance represents 70% of energy losses for cars above 90 km/h). Since vehicle design cannot be significantly modified, due to marketing or structural reasons, active flow control technologies are one of the most promising approaches to improve aerodynamic performance. This consists in introducing micro-devices, like pulsating jets or vibrating membranes, that can modify vortices generated by vehicles. Thanks to flow non-linearities, a small energy expense for actuation can significantly reduce energy losses. The efficiency of this approach has been demonstrated, experimentally as well as numerically, for simple configurations  <ref xlink:href="#acumes-2016-bid87" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>. However, the lack of efficient and flexible numerical models, that allow to simulate and optimize a large number of such devices on realistic configurations, is still a bottleneck for the emergence of this technology in an industrial context. In particular, the prediction of actuated flows requires the use of advanced turbulence closures, like Detached Eddy Simulation or Large Eddy Simulation  <ref xlink:href="#acumes-2016-bid88" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>.

is widely recognized. In this perspective,
traffic flow models are a commonly cited example of "complex systems",
in which individual behavior and self-organization phenomena must be taken into account to obtain a realistic description
of the observed macroscopic dynamics  <ref xlink:href="#acumes-2016-bid89" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>. Further improvements require more advanced models, keeping into better account interactions at the microscopic scale, and adapted control techniques, see  <ref xlink:href="#acumes-2016-bid90" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/> and references therein.
In particular, we will focus on the following aspects:</p>
      <simplelist>
        <li id="uid27">
          <p noindent="true"><i>Junction models.</i> We are interested in designing a general junction model both satisfying basic analytical properties
guaranteeing well-posedness and being realistic for traffic applications. In particular,
the model should be able to overcome severe drawbacks of existing models, such as
restrictions on the number of involved roads and prescribed split ratios  <ref xlink:href="#acumes-2016-bid91" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>, <ref xlink:href="#acumes-2016-bid92" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>, which limit their applicability to
real world situations.
Hamilton-Jacobi equations could be also an interesting direction of research, following the recent results obtained in  <ref xlink:href="#acumes-2016-bid93" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>.</p>
        </li>
        <li id="uid28">
          <p noindent="true"><i>Data assimilation.</i>
In traffic flow modeling, the capability of correctly estimating and predicting the state of the system depends on the availability of rich and accurate data on the network.
Up to now, the most classical sensors are fixed ones.
They are composed of inductive loops (electrical wires) that are installed at different spatial positions of the network and that can measure the traffic flow, the occupancy rate (i.e. the proportion of time during which a vehicle is detected to be over the loop) and the speed (in case of a system of two distant loops).
These data are useful / essential to calibrate the phenomenological relationship between flow and density which is known in the traffic literature as the Fundamental Diagram.
Nowadays, thanks to the wide development of mobile internet and geolocalization techniques and its increasing adoption by the road users, smartphones have turned into perfect mobile sensors in many domains, including in traffic flow management.
They can provide the research community with a large database of individual trajectory sets that are known as Floating Car Data (FCD),
see <ref xlink:href="#acumes-2016-bid94" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/> for a real field experiment.
Classical macroscopic models, say (hyperbolic systems of) conservation laws, are not designed to take into account this new kind of microscopic data.
Other formulations, like Hamilton-Jacobi partial differential equations, are most suited and have been intensively studied in the past five years (see  <ref xlink:href="#acumes-2016-bid95" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>, <ref xlink:href="#acumes-2016-bid96" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>), with a stress on the (fixed) Eulerian framework.
Up to our knowledge, there exist a few studies in the time-Lagrangian as well as space-Lagrangian frameworks,
where data coming from mobile sensors could be easily assimilated, due to the fact that the Lagrangian coordinate (say the label of a vehicle) is fixed.</p>

          <p noindent="true"><i>Control of autonomous vehicles.</i> Traffic flow is usually controlled via traffic lights or variable speed limits, which have fixed space locations.
The deployment of autonomous vehicles opens new perspectives in traffic management, as the use of a small fraction of cars to optimize the overall traffic.
In this perspective, the possibility to track vehicles trajectories either by coupled micro-macro models  <ref xlink:href="#acumes-2016-bid2" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>, <ref xlink:href="#acumes-2016-bid6" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>
or via the Hamilton-Jacobi approach  <ref xlink:href="#acumes-2016-bid95" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>, <ref xlink:href="#acumes-2016-bid96" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>
could allow to optimize the flow
by controlling some specific vehicles corresponding to internal conditions.</p>

      <bodyTitle>Concurrent design for building systems</bodyTitle>
      <p>Building industry has to face more and more stringent requirements, including energy performance, structural safety and environmental impact. To this end, new materials and new technologies have emerged   <ref xlink:href="#acumes-2016-bid97" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/> to help the construction firms meet these requirements. At the same time, many different teams or firms interact, most of the interaction being of non-cooperative nature. The teams involved in construction have different goals, depending on which stage they operate. Indeed, the lifetime of a building goes through three stages: construction, use and destruction.
To each of these phases correspond quality criteria related in particular to:</p>
      <simplelist>
        <li id="uid31">
          <p noindent="true">Safety: structural, fire, evacuation, chemical spread, etc.</p>
        </li>
        <li id="uid32">
          <p noindent="true">Well-being of its occupants: thermal and acoustic comfort.</p>

        <li id="uid33">
          <p noindent="true">Functionality of its intended use.</p>

        <li id="uid34">
          <p noindent="true">Environmental impact.</p>
        </li>
      </simplelist>
      <p>These stages and criteria form a complex system, the so-called building system, whose overall quality (in an intuitive sense) is directly impacted by many heterogeneous factors, such as the geographical location or the shape or material composition of some of its components (windows, frames, thermal convectors positions, etc.)
It is obvious that the optimization process of these settings must be performed at the "zero" stage of the project design. Moreover, the optimization process has to follow a global approach, taking into account all the concurrent criteria that intervene in the design of building systems.</p>
      <p>The application of up-to-date concurrent optimization machinery (games, Pareto Fronts) for multiphysics systems involved in the building is an original approach.
With our industrial partner, who wishes routine use of new high performance components in the construction of buildings, we expect that our approach will yield
breakthrough performances (with respect to the above criteria) compared to the current standards.</p>
      <p>The research project relies on the ADT BuildingSmart (see software development section) for the implementation of industrial standard software demonstrators.</p>

      <p>Besides the above mentioned axes, which constitute the project's identity, the methodological tools described in Section
have a wider range of application.
We currently carry on also the following research actions, in collaboration with external partners.</p>
      <simplelist>
        <li id="uid36">
          <p noindent="true"><b>Modeling cell dynamics.</b>
Migration and proliferation of epithelial cell sheets are the two keystone aspects of the collective cell dynamics in most biological processes such as morphogenesis, embryogenesis, cancer and wound healing. It is then of utmost importance to understand their underlying mechanisms.</p>
          <p>Semilinear reaction-diffusion equations are widely used to give a phenomenological description of the temporal and spatial changes occurring within cell populations that undergo scattering (moving), spreading (expanding cell surface) and proliferation. We have followed the same methodology and contributed to assess the validity of such approaches in different settings (cell sheets  <ref xlink:href="#acumes-2016-bid98" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>, dorsal closure  <ref xlink:href="#acumes-2016-bid99" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>, actin organization  <ref xlink:href="#acumes-2016-bid100" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>).
However, epithelial cell-sheet movement is complex enough to undermine most of the mathematical approaches based on <i>locality</i>, that is mainly traveling wavefront-like partial differential equations. In <ref xlink:href="#acumes-2016-bid101" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/> it is shown that Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells extend cryptic lamellipodia to drive the migration, several rows behind the wound edge. In <ref xlink:href="#acumes-2016-bid102" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/> MDCK monolayers are shown to exhibit similar non-local behavior (long range velocity fields, very active border-localized leader cells).</p>
          <p>Our aim is to start from a mesoscopic description of cell interaction:
considering cells as independent anonymous agents, we plan to investigate the use of mathematical techniques adapted from the mean-field game theory. Otherwise, looking at them as interacting particles, we will use a multi-agent approach (at least for the actin dynamics). We intend also to consider approaches stemming from compartment-based simulation in the spirit of those developed in   <ref xlink:href="#acumes-2016-bid7" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>, <ref xlink:href="#acumes-2016-bid8" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>, <ref xlink:href="#acumes-2016-bid9" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>.</p>

          <p>Atherosclerosis or arterial calcification is a major vascular disease, caused by fatty deposits on the inner walls of arteries. Angioplasty techniques propose several solutions to remedy this pathology. We are interested in those which consist in introducing a metallic stent, to crush the lipid plaques, and ensure permanent enlargement of the damaged arterial wall.
The implementation of such an element is accompanied by an immune reaction of the arterial walls, which is manifested by an accelerated proliferation of cells within the so called media, which highlights two major risks: restenosis, and thrombosis . One promising technique is to introduce a "Drug Eluting Stent", which is a metallic stent coated with a polymer layer containing an antiproliferative drug to slow the proliferation process, in order to improve the functioning of the stent. Our major objective in this part is to setup and develop the mathematical modeling and computational tools that lead to the effective estimation of the Fractional Flow Reserve   <ref xlink:href="#acumes-2016-bid103" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>, which is a promising new technique to help the cardiologists take decisions on stent implantation.</p>

Thermoelastography is an innovative non-invasive control technology, which has numerous advantages over other techniques, notably in medical imaging <ref xlink:href="#acumes-2016-bid104" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>. Indeed,
it is well known that most pathological changes are associated with changes in tissue stiffness, while remaining isoechoic, and hence difficult to detect by ultrasound techniques.
Based on elastic waves and heat flux reconstruction, thermoelastography shows no destructive or aggressive medical sequel, unlike X-ray and comparables techniques, making it a potentially prominent choice for patients.</p>
          <p>Physical principles of thermoelastography originally rely on dynamical structural responses of tissues, but as a first approach, we only consider static responses of linear elastic structures.</p>
          <p noindent="true">The mathematical formulation of the thermoelasticity reconstruction is based on data completion and material identification, making it a harsh ill posed inverse problem.

          <p noindent="true"><b>Constraint elimination in Quasi-Newton methods.</b>
In single-objective differentiable optimization, Newton's method requires the specification of both gradient and Hessian.
As a result, the convergence is quadratic, and Newton's method is often considered as the target reference.
However, in applications to distributed systems, the functions to be minimized are usually “functionals”, which
depend on
the optimization variables by the solution of an often complex set of PDE's,
through a chain of computational procedures.
Hence,
the exact calculation of the full Hessian becomes a complex and costly computational endeavor.</p>
          <p>This has fostered the development of
<i>quasi-Newton's methods</i> that mimic Newton's method but use only the gradient, the Hessian being iteratively
constructed by successive approximations inside the algorithm itself. Among such methods,
the Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS) algorithm is well-known and commonly employed.
In this method, the Hessian is corrected at each new iteration by rank-one matrices defined from several evaluations
of the gradient only. The BFGS method has "super-linear convergence".</p>
          <p>For constrained problems,
certain authors have developed so-called
<i>Riemannian BFGS</i>, e.g. <ref xlink:href="#acumes-2016-bid107" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>, that have the desirable convergence property in
constrained problems. However, in this approach, the constraints are assumed to be known formally,
by explicit expressions.</p>
          <p>In collaboration with ONERA-Meudon,
we are exploring the possibility of representing constraints, in successive iterations, through local
approximations of the constraint surfaces, splitting the design space locally into tangent and normal sub-spaces,
and eliminating the normal coordinates through a linearization, or more generally a finite expansion, and applying
the BFGS method through dependencies on the coordinates in the tangent subspace only. Preliminary experiments on the
difficult Rosenbrock test-case, although in low dimensions, demonstrate the feasibility of this approach.
On-going research is on theorizing this method, and testing cases of higher dimensions.</p>

subject to a finite-element solution involving a large number of dof's. CEA disposes of such codes, but
considering the computational cost
of the objective functions in the complex cases, the first part of our study is focused on the construction
and validation of meta-models, typically of RBF-type. Multi-objective optimization will be carried out
subsequently by MGDA, and possibly Nash games.</p>

      <p>In collaboration with M.L. Delle Monache and B. Piccoli, and in the framework of the Associated Team ORESTE,
we have introduced a new Riemann solver for traffic flow on networks. The Priority Riemann solver (PRS) provides a solution at junctions by taking into consideration priorities for the incoming roads and maximization of through flux. We prove existence of solutions for the solver for junctions with up to two incoming and two outgoing roads and show numerically the comparison with previous Riemann solvers. Additionally, we introduce a second version of the solver that considers the priorities as softer constraints and illustrate numerically the differences between the two solvers. See <ref xlink:href="#acumes-2016-bid108" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>.</p>
      <p>Still in collaboration with M.L. Delle Monache, we studied well-posedness of scalar conservation laws with moving flux constraints arising in the modeling
of moving bottlenecks in traffic flow. In particular, we showed the Lipschitz continuous dependence of BV solutions with respect to the initial data and the constraint trajectory
<ref xlink:href="#acumes-2016-bid109" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>.</p>
      <p>In collaboration with S. Göttlich and O. Kolb, we have investigated how second order traffic flow models, in our case the Aw-Rascle equations, can be used to reproduce empirical observations such as the capacity drop at merges and solve related optimal control problems. To this aim, we have proposed a model for on-ramp junctions and derive suitable coupling conditions. These are associated to the first order Godunov scheme to numerically study the well-known capacity drop effect, where the outflow of the system is significantly below the expected maximum. Control issues such as speed and ramp meter control have also been addressed in a first discretize-then optimize framework <ref xlink:href="#acumes-2016-bid110" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>.</p>
      <p>Together with J. A. Laval and B. R. Chilukuri, we have investigated the implications of source terms in the Hamilton-Jacobi formulation of macroscopic first order traffic flow models. Hamilton-Jacobi equations (without source terms) have been demonstrated to be very useful in traffic flow engineering since they provide explicit formula for initial and boundary-values problems. However, for sake of realism, additional source terms should be incorporated to account for continuous inflows or outflows on freeways for instance.
We showed that explicit Lax-Hopf formula can still be obtained when the source term is exogenous,
say the lateral inflow or outflow does not depend on the density on the main road.
We also provide numerical methods based on Bellman's dynamic programming principle
to deal with non-exogenous source terms in discrete time
<ref xlink:href="#acumes-2016-bid111" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>.</p>
      <p>With A. Duret, we have designed a new traffic flow model for taking into account the multiclass and multilane features of real traffic. This model is based on a system of coupled Hamilton-Jacobi PDEs for an appropriate choice of framework that mixes spatial and Lagrangian coordinates. The coupling conditions emerge from the moving bottleneck theory that has been developed in the traffic flow literature several years ago but for which a real mathematical sound basis lacked. Very recently, there were some new results dealing with the existence of a solution under suitable assumptions <ref xlink:href="#acumes-2016-bid2" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>. However, these results were set for the hyperbolic conservation law in Eulerian coordinates and they are not straightforward to be extended to Hamilton-Jacobi equations in different coordinates. Despite that the well-posedness of the problem is still an open problem, a numerical method is developed by taking advantage of the classical representation formula available for HJ PDEs. This numerical scheme has been proved to provide good qualitative results
<ref xlink:href="#acumes-2016-bid112" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>.</p>
      <p>In collaboration with A. Tordeux, M. Herty and A. Seyfried, we studied the derivation of convection-diffusion macroscopic traffic flow models from a first order microscopic follow-the-leader model that takes into account a non-trivial time delay.
The derivation is based on a change of variables from Lagrangian to Eulerian coordinates and makes use of Taylor expansions with respect to the time delay.
The macroscopic diffusion term is due to the microscopic reaction time parameter and allows to reproduce the scatter of empirical flow-density data.
Different numerical methods are proposed for computing the numerical flux and the linear stability of the homogeneous solutions obtained for each method is investigated. Interestingly, we recover some stability results for infinite systems of delayed ODEs <ref xlink:href="#acumes-2016-bid113" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>.</p>

      <p>As a first step in this direction,
we have proved global well-posedness results for weak entropy solutions of bounded variation (BV) of scalar conservation laws with non-local flux on bounded domains
in one space dimension, under suitable regularity assumptions on the flux function. In particular, existence is obtained by proving the convergence of an adapted Lax-Friedrichs algorithm. Lipschitz continuos dependence from initial and boundary data is derived applying Kružhkov 's doubling of
variable technique <ref xlink:href="#acumes-2016-bid114" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>.</p>

      <p>We have designed Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) schemes and Finite Volume WENO (FV-WENO) schemes to obtain high-order approximations
of the solutions of a class of non-local conservation laws in one space dimension.
The DG schemes give the best numerical results but their CFL condition is very restrictive.
On the contrary, FV-WENO schemes can be used with larger time steps.
The evaluation of the convolution terms necessitates the use of quadratic polynomials reconstructions in each cell in order to obtain the high-order accuracy with the FV-WENO approach.

      <p>The use of high-order numerical schemes is necessary to reduce numerical diffusion/dispersion in simulations, maintain a reasonable computational time for 3D problems, estimate accurately uncertainties or sensitivities, etc.
Moreover, the capability to handle exactly CAD data in physical solvers is desirable to foster design optimization or multidisciplinary couplings.</p>
      <p>Consequently, we develop high-order isogeometric schemes for the applications targeted by the team, in particular for convection-dominated problems. Specifically, we investigate a Discontinuous Galerkin method for compressible Euler equations, based on an isogeometric formulation: the partial differential equations governing the flow are solved on rational parametric elements, that preserve exactly the geometry of boundaries defined by Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines (NURBS), while the same rational approximation space is adopted for the solution. This topic is partially studied in A. Azaouzi's PhD work.</p>

      <p>While the sensitivity equation method is a common approach for parabolic systems, its use for hyperbolic ones is still tedious, because of the generation of discontinuities in the state solution, yielding Dirac distributions in the sensitivity solution.</p>
      <p>To overcome this difficulty, we investigate a modified sensitivity equation, that includes an additional source term when the state solution exhibits discontinuities, to avoid the generation of delta-peaks in the sensitivity solution. We consider as example the one-dimensional barotropic Euler equations. Different approaches are tested to integrate the additional source term: a Roe solver, a Godunov method and a moving cells approach. This study is achieved in collaboration with C. Chalons from University of Versailles, in the context of C. FIorini's PhD work.</p>

      <p>The uncertainty related to turbulence modeling is still a bottleneck in realistic flows simulation. Therefore, some studies have been conducted to quantify this uncertainty for two problems in which turbulence plays a critical role. Firstly, the impact of the model choice has been estimated in the case of a massively detached flow over a 2D backward facing step including an oscillatory active control device, whose parameters are optimized <ref xlink:href="#acumes-2016-bid116" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>.

      <p>Optimization of real-life applications requires to account for the uncertainties arising during the performance evaluation procedure, that could be either experimental or numerical. A Gaussian-Process based optimization algorithm has been proposed to efficiently determine the global optimum in presence of noise, whose amplitude can be user-defined or inferred from observations. The method has been applied to two very different problems related to performance optimization in sport.</p>
      <p>The first case corresponds to the optimization of the shape of a racing kayak, in the framework of SOKA project, in preparation to 2016 Olympic Games. The performance is estimated by coupling Newton's law with incompressible Navier-Stokes equations to compute the kayak velocity from the effort of the athlete, considered as input. The proposed method has been used here to filter the noise arising from the numerical simulation <ref xlink:href="#acumes-2016-bid118" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>, <ref xlink:href="#acumes-2016-bid119" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>. This work is conducted in collaboration with Ecole Centrale de Nantes and National Kayak Federation.</p>
      <p>The second case corresponds to the optimization of a sail trimming, whose performance can be estimated either experimentally in a wind tunnel, or numerically by solving a fluid-structure interaction problem. In the former case, uncertainty has been estimated according to measurements accuracy, while in the latter case the numerical noise has be inferred from a set of observations collected during the optimization<ref xlink:href="#acumes-2016-bid120" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>.

      <p>In a previous paper <ref xlink:href="#acumes-2016-bid98" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>, we have shown that the well-known Fisher-KPP equations are able to model the natural wound closure of cell-sheets. This family of equations, with constant coefficients, exhibit progressive fronts with constant speed and we have proved by confronting to experiments that F-KPP is remarkabely able to predict the dynamics of experimental wounds. However, this is no more the case when the cell-sheet is either inhibited or activated exogeneously. In this case, we used a F-KKP equation with time-dependent coefficients, and proved again that with this modification we were able to capture the wound dynamics <ref xlink:href="#acumes-2016-bid121" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>. To take into account further biological features in the mathematical model, we implemented a coupling between the mechanical behavior of the cell tissue and the evolution of the density, using classical linear visco-elastic models from the literature.
Our present effort is on assessing the ability of the mechano-biological coupled system to render some of the cell-sheet dynamics that are missing from the Fisher-KPP equation alone.</p>

      <p>In this work, we are interested in solving the electrocardiography inverse problem which could
be reduced to the data completion problem for the Poisson equation. The difficulty comes from
the fact that the conductivity values of the torso organs like lungs, bones, liver,...etc, are not known
and could be patient dependent. Our goal is to construct a methodology allowing to solve both
data completion and conductivity optimization problems at the same time.</p>

Our algorithm turned out to be efficient and robust with respect to noisy data. In a first attempt, presented in <ref xlink:href="#acumes-2016-bid122" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>, we formulated the identification-completion problem as a Stackelberg game. Some numerical experiments were successful in this joint identification, but some were not. Which led us to develop new formulations, with direct impact on the technological modus operandi in the theoretical tomography process. In few words, the new formulations are based on the remark that not all the over-specified data are necessary to ensure the existence and uniqueness for the Cauchy problem, since by Holmgren theorem, only a piece of these data (over a subset of the boundary with non zero superficial measure) is necessary and sufficient. Presently, we are investigating the ability of these new formulations to ensure identifiability of the conductivity coefficients, for Poisson and linear elasticity equations.</p>

      <p>Our aim here is to show that the Bayesian Optimization -BO- apparatus can be applied to the search of game equilibria,
and in particular the classical Nash equilibrium (NE), known to be very costly the compute, notably when involved in the framework of large scale scientific computing areas.</p>
      <p>BO relies on Gaussian processes, which are used as emulators (or surrogates) of the black-box model outputs based on a small set of model evaluations. Posterior distributions provided by the Gaussian process are used to design <i>acquisition functions</i>
that guide sequential search strategies that balance between exploration and exploitation.</p>
      <p>We have proposed in <ref xlink:href="#acumes-2016-bid123" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/> a novel approach to solve Nash games with drastically limited budgets of evaluations based on GP regression, taking the form of a Bayesian optimization algorithm. Experiments on challenging benchmark problems demonstrate the potential of this approach compared to classical, derivative-based algorithms.</p>
      <p>On the test problems, two acquisition functions performed similarly well. The first one, Stepwise Uncertainty Reduction -SUR- has recently emerged in the machine learning community. We introduced a new one, the Probability of Equilibrium <formula type="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" overflow="scroll"><msub><mi>P</mi><mi>E</mi></msub></math></formula>, which has the benefit of not relying on conditional simulation paths, which makes it simpler to implement and less computationally intensive in most cases. Still, the SUR approach has several decisive advantages; in particular, it does not actually require the new observations to belong to the grid (sampling of the , such that it could be optimized continuously.
Moreover, it lays the groundwork for many extensions that may be pursued in future work.</p>
      <p>First, SUR strategies are well-suited to allow selecting batches of points instead of only one, a key feature in distributed computer experiments. Second, other games and equilibria may be considered: the versatility of the SUR approach may allow its transposition to other frameworks, such as mixed-strategies or Bayesian games. In particular, our framework transposes directly to the case of noisy evaluations, as it can be directly modeled by the GPs without affecting the acquisition functions.</p>

      <p>Fokker-Planck-Kolmogorov (FPK) equations are PDEs which govern the dynamics of the probability density function (PDF) of continuous-time stochastic processes (e.g. Ito processes). In   <ref xlink:href="#acumes-2016-bid34" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/> a FPK-constrained control framework, where the drift was considered as control variable is developed and applied to crowd motion.</p>

The players strategies are the drifts, which yield two uncoupled FPK equations for the corresponding PDFs. The interaction is done through cost functions : each player would prefer to avoid overcrowding (w.r.t. the other one, hence the coupling) additionally to have her own preferred trajectory and obstacle avoidance. In this particular setting, we prove the existence and uniqueness of the Nash equilibrium (NE). The NE is computed by means of a fixed point algorithm and adjoint-state method is used to compute the pseudo-gradients. We finally present some numerical experiments to illustrate which dynamics may arise from such equilibria.</p>

      <p>A multiobjective strategy adapted to the aerodynamic concurrent optimization of helicopter rotor blades
is developed. The present strategy is based on Nash games from game theory, where the objective functions
are minimized by virtual players involved in a noncooperative concurrent game. A method is presented
to split the design vector into two subspaces, defined to be the strategies of the players in charge
of the minimization of the primary and the secondary objective functions, respectively. This split
of territory allows the optimization of the secondary function while causing the least possible
degradation of the first one. This methodology is applied to the model rotor ERATO, seeking to maximize
the figure of merit in hover while minimizing the required rotor power in forward flight, assuming
frozen structural properties. An initial constrained optimization in hover is conducted using a previously
developed adjoint-based technique using the three-dimensional Navier–Stokes solver elsA along
with the gradient-based CONMIN algorithm. The chord, twist, and sweep distributions of the baseline blade
are parameterized using Bézier and cubic splines for a total of 16 design variables. The obtained optimized
rotor is then used as a starting point to launch constrained and unconstrained Nash games. The comprehensive
rotor code Eurocopter's Helicopter Overall Simulation Tool (HOST) is used to evaluate forward flight
performance, and a surrogate model is built to obtain the hover performance at low computational cost.
Twist and sweep distribution laws are optimized independently at first, and then a final joint optimization
involving twist, sweep, and chord is performed. The results demonstrate the potential of this technique
to obtain helicopter rotor designs realizing interesting trade-offs between strongly antagonistic objectives

are also marched in time, and this provides the six-component parametric gradient
of drag. When the periodic regime is reached numerically, one thus disposes of an
objective-function, drag, to be minimized, and its parametric gradient, at all times
of a period. Second, the parametric optimization is conducted as a multi-point problem
by the Multiple-Gradient Descent Algorithm (MGDA) which permits to reduce
the objective-function at all times simultaneously, and not simply in the sense of a
weighted average

      <p>We have proposed a new method for multiobjective optimization problems in which the objective functions
are expressed as expectations of random functions. This method is based on an extension of
the classical stochastic gradient algorithm and a deterministic multiobjective algorithm,
the Multiple-Gradient Descent Algorithm (MGDA). In MGDA a descent direction common to all
specified objective functions is identified through a result of convex geometry. The use of this
common descent vector and the Pareto stationarity definition into the stochastic gradient algorithm
makes the algorithm able to solve multiobjective problems. The mean square and almost sure
convergence of this new algorithm are proven considering the classical stochastic gradient
algorithm hypothesis. The algorithm efficiency is illustrated on two academic examples and
its performance is compared to the deterministic MGDA algorithm coupled with a Monte-Carlo
expectation estimator. A third example is treated, considering the optimization of a sandwich
material under constitutive material uncertainties.</p>

      <p>A new goal-oriented mesh adaptation method for finite volume/finite difference schemes is extended
from the structured mesh framework to a more suitable setting for adaptation of unstructured meshes.
The method is based on the total derivative of the goal with respect to volume mesh nodes that is computable
after the solution of the goal discrete adjoint equation. The asymptotic behaviour of this derivative is
assessed on regularly refined unstructured meshes. A local refinement criterion is derived from the requirement
of limiting the first order change in the goal that an admissible node displacement may cause. Mesh adaptations
are then carried out for classical test cases of 2D Euler flows. Efficiency and local density of the adapted
meshes are presented. They are compared with those obtained with a more classical mesh adaptation method in the
framework of finite volume/finite difference schemes [46]. Results are very close although the present method
only makes usage of the current grid

      <p>In differentiable optimization, the Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS) method is one of the most
efficient methods for unconstrained problems. Besides function values, it only requires the specification of the gradient.
An approximate Hessian is calculated by successive approximations as part of the iteration, using rank-1 correction matrices.
As a result, the iteration has superlinear convergence : when minimizing a quadratic function in <formula type="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" overflow="scroll"><mi>n</mi></math></formula> variables, if the
one-dimensional minimizations in the calculated directions of search are done exactly, the Hessian matrix approximation
is exact after <formula type="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" overflow="scroll"><mi>n</mi></math></formula> iterations, and from this, the iteration identifies to Newton's iteration, and produces the exact local optimum
in only one additional iteration (<formula type="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" overflow="scroll"><mrow><mi>n</mi><mo>+</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></math></formula> in total).</p>
      <p>However the BFGS method does extend to constrained problems very simply.
Following Gabay  <ref xlink:href="#acumes-2016-bid128" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/> and other authors, Chunhong Qi <i>et al</i> <ref xlink:href="#acumes-2016-bid107" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>
have proposed a “Riemannian” variant, RBFGS
that indeed incorporates equality constraints in the formulation and actually demonstrates superior convergence rates for
problems with a large number of variables. However these Riemannian formulations are non trivial to implement since they require
procedures implementing non-trivial differential-geometry operators ('retraction' and 'metric transport') to be developed.
In their paper, they assume a formal expression of the constraint to be known.
But, in PDE-constrained optimization, many constraints are functional, and it is not clear how can the
metric transport operator in particular can be defined.</p>
      <p>We are investigating how can a quasi-Riemannian method can be defined based on the sole definition of evaluation procedures for
the gradients. By condensing all the equality constraints in one, a purely-explicit approximate retraction operator has been defined
that yields a point whose distance to the contraint surface is fourth-order at least. The associated transport
operator is currently being examined formally. These techniques will be experimented in the context of constrained optimum-shape
design in aerodynamics <ref xlink:href="#acumes-2016-bid129" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/></p>

      <p>Multiple models of a physical phenomenon are sometimes available with different levels of approximation. The high fidelity model
is more computation-ally demanding than the coarse approximation. In this context, including information from the lower fidelity model
to build a surrogate model is desirable. Here, the study focuses on the design of a miniaturized photoacoustic gas sensor
which involves two numerical mod- els. First, a multifidelity metamodeling method based on Radial Basis Function, the co-RBF,
is proposed. This surrogate model is compared with the classical co-kriging method on two analytical benchmarks and on the photoacoustic
gas sensor. Then an extension to the multifidelity framework of an already existing RBF- based optimization algorithm
is applied to optimize the sensor efficiency. The co-RBF method brings promising results on a problem in larger
dimension and can be considered as an alternative to co-kriging for multifidelity metamodeling.</p>
