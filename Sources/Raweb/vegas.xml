      <bodyTitle>Overall Objectives</bodyTitle>
      <p>The main scientific objective of the <ref xlink:href="http://www.loria.fr/equipes/vegas/" location="extern" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest">VEGAS</ref> research team is to
<i>contribute to the development of an effective geometric computing</i>
dedicated to <i>non-trivial geometric objects</i>. Included among its main
tasks are the study and development of new algorithms for the manipulation
of geometric objects, the experimentation of algorithms, the production of
high-quality software, and the application of such algorithms and
implementations to research domains that deal with a large amount of
geometric data, notably solid modeling and computer graphics.</p>
      <p>Computational geometry has traditionally treated linear objects like
line segments and polygons in the plane, and point sets and polytopes
in three-dimensional space, occasionally (and more recently) venturing
into the world of non-linear curves such as circles and ellipses. The
methodological experience and the know-how accumulated over the last
thirty years have been enormous.</p>
      <p>For many applications, particularly in the fields of computer graphics
and solid modeling, it is necessary to manipulate more general objects
such as curves and surfaces given in either implicit or parametric
form. Typically such objects are handled by approximating them by
simple objects such as triangles. This approach is extremely important
and it has been used in almost all of the usable software existing in
industry today. It does, however, have some disadvantages. Using a
tessellated form in place of its exact geometry may introduce spurious
numerical errors (the famous gap between the wing and the body of the
aircraft), not to mention that thousands if not hundreds of thousands
of triangles could be needed to adequately represent the
object. Moreover, the curved objects that we consider are not
necessarily everyday three-dimensional objects, but also abstract
mathematical objects that are not linear, that may live in
high-dimensional space, and whose geometry we do not control. For
example, the set of lines in 3D (at the core of visibility issues)
that are tangent to three polyhedra span a piecewise ruled quadratic
surface, and the lines tangent to a sphere correspond, in projective
five-dimensional space, to the intersection of two quadratic
hypersurfaces.</p>
      <p><i>Effectiveness</i> is a key word of our research project. By
requiring our algorithms to be effective, we imply that the algorithms
should be <i>robust,</i> <i>efficient,</i> and <i>versatile</i>. By
robust we mean algorithms that do not crash on degenerate inputs and
always output topologically consistent data. By efficient we mean
algorithms that run reasonably quickly on realistic data where
performance is ascertained both experimentally and theoretically.
Finally, by versatile we mean algorithms that work for classes of
objects that are general enough to cover realistic situations and that
account for the <i>exact geometry</i> of the objects, in particular
when they are curved.</p>

    <subsection id="uid5" level="1">
      <bodyTitle>Computer Graphics</bodyTitle>
      <p>We are
interested in the application of our work to
virtual prototyping, which refers to the many steps required for the
creation of a realistic virtual representation from a CAD/CAM model.</p>
      <p>When designing an automobile, detailed physical mockups of the interior are
built to study the design and evaluate human factors and ergonomic issues.
These hand-made prototypes are costly, time consuming, and difficult to
modify. To shorten the design cycle and improve interactivity and
reliability, realistic rendering and immersive virtual reality provide an
effective alternative. A virtual prototype can replace a physical mockup
for the analysis of such design aspects as visibility of instruments and
mirrors, reachability and accessibility, and aesthetics and appeal.</p>
      <p>Virtual prototyping encompasses most of our work on effective geometric
computing. In particular, our work on 3D visibility should
have fruitful applications in this domain. As already explained, meshing
objects of the scene along the main discontinuities of the visibility
function can have a dramatic impact on the realism of the simulations.

    <subsection id="uid6" level="1">
      <bodyTitle>Solid Modeling</bodyTitle>
      <p>Solid modeling, i.e., the computer representation and manipulation of 3D
shapes, has historically developed somewhat in parallel to computational
geometry. Both communities are concerned with geometric algorithms and deal
with many of the same issues. But while the computational geometry
community has been mathematically inclined and essentially concerned with
linear objects, solid modeling has traditionally had closer ties to
industry and has been more concerned with curved surfaces.</p>
      <p>Clearly, there is considerable potential for interaction between the two
fields. Standing somewhere in the middle, our project has a lot to offer.
Among the geometric questions related to solid modeling that are of
interest to us, let us mention: the description of geometric shapes, the
representation of solids, the conversion between different representations,
data structures for graphical rendering of models and robustness of
geometric computations.

      <p noindent="true">Isotop is a Maple software for computing the topology of an algebraic plane curve, that is, for
computing an arrangement of polylines isotopic to the input curve. This problem is a necessary key
step for computing arrangements of algebraic curves and has also applications for curve plotting.</p>
      <p>This software, registered at the APP in June 2011, has been developed since 2007
in collaboration with F. Rouillier from Inria Paris. The distributed version is
based on the method described in <ref xlink:href="#vegas-2016-bid0" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>, which
presents several improvements over previous methods. In particular, our approach
does not require generic position.
This version is competitive with
other implementations (such as <span class="smallcap" align="left">AlciX</span> and <span class="smallcap" align="left">Insulate</span>
developed at MPII Saarbrücken, Germany and <span class="smallcap" align="left">top</span> developed at
Santander Univ., Spain). It performs similarly for small-degree curves and
performs significantly better for higher degrees, in particular when the curves
are not in generic position.</p>
      <p>We are currently working on an improved version integrating a new
bivariate polynomial solver based on several of our recent results published in
<ref xlink:href="#vegas-2016-bid1" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>.
This version is not yet distributed.</p>
      <p>Via the Inria ADT FastTrack funding, Eric Biagioli has joined the project in
November 2016 for 6 months. He is porting the maple code to C code and
enhancing the visualization. This work will prepare for a better diffusion of
the software via a webserver and a transfert to Maplesoft with which Inria has
signed a contract in April 2016.</p>

      <bodyTitle>SubdivisionSolver</bodyTitle>
      <p><span class="smallcap" align="left">Keywords:</span> Numerical solver - Polynomial or analytical systems</p>
      <p spacebefore="6.0pt" noindent="true">The software SubdivisionSolver solves square systems of analytic equations on a compact
subset of a real space of any finite dimension. SubdivisionSolver is a numerical
solver and as such it requires that the solutions in the subset are isolated and
regular for the input system (i.e. the Jacobian must not vanish). SubdivisionSolver is
a subdivision solver using interval arithmetic and multiprecision arithmetic to
achieve certified results. If the arithmetic precision required to isolate
solutions is known, it can be given as an input parameter of the process,
otherwise the precision is increased on the fly. In particular, SubdivisionSolver can
be interfaced with the Fast_Polynomial library
(<ref xlink:href="https://bil.inria.fr/en/software/view/2423/tab" location="extern" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest">https://<allowbreak/>bil.<allowbreak/>inria.<allowbreak/>fr/<allowbreak/>en/<allowbreak/>software/<allowbreak/>view/<allowbreak/>2423/<allowbreak/>tab</ref>) to solve polynomial
systems that are large in terms of degree, number of monomials and bit-size of
coefficients.</p>
      <p>The software is based on a classic branch and bound algorithm using interval
arithmetic: an initial box is subdivided until its sub-boxes are certified to
contain either no solution or a unique solution of the input system. Evaluation
is performed with a centered evaluation at order two, and existence and
uniqueness of solutions is verified thanks to the Krawczyk operator.</p>
      <p>SubdivisionSolver uses two implementations of interval arithmetic: the C++ boost
library that provides a fast arithmetic when double precision is enough, and
otherwise the C mpfi library that allows to work in arbitrary precision.
Considering the subdivision process as a breadth first search in a tree, the
boost interval arithmetic is used as deeply as possible before a new subdivision
process using higher precision arithmetic is performed on the remaining forest.</p>
      <p>The software has been improved and a technical report published <ref xlink:href="#vegas-2016-bid2" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>.</p>

Our main objective is to describe

In general, the curve
<formula type="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" overflow="scroll"><mi>𝒞</mi></math></formula> is not a regular submanifold of <formula type="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" overflow="scroll"><msup><mi>ℝ</mi><mn>2</mn></msup></math></formula> and describing it
requires to isolate the points of its singularity locus <formula type="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" overflow="scroll"><mi>Σ</mi></math></formula>.</p>
        <p>In previous work, we have shown how to describe the set of singularities
<formula type="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" overflow="scroll"><mi>Σ</mi></math></formula> of <formula type="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" overflow="scroll"><mi>𝒞</mi></math></formula> as regular solutions of a so-called ball system
suitable for a numerical subdivision solver. In our current work, the space
curve is first enclosed in a set of boxes with a certified path-tracker to
restrict the domain where the ball system is solved. Boxes around singular
points are then computed such that the correct topology of the curve inside
these boxes can be deduced from the intersections of the curve with their
boundaries. The tracking of the space curve is then used to connect the smooth
branches to the singular points. The subdivision of the plane induced by the curve
is encoded as an extended planar combinatorial map allowing point location.
This work is not already published but has been presented by R. Imbach at the

        <bodyTitle>Quadric Arrangement in Classifying Rigid Motions of a 3D
Digital Image</bodyTitle>
        <p>Rigid motions are fundamental operations in image processing. While
bijective and isometric in <formula type="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" overflow="scroll"><msup><mi>ℝ</mi><mn>3</mn></msup></math></formula>, they lose these properties when
digitized in <formula type="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" overflow="scroll"><msup><mi>ℤ</mi><mn>3</mn></msup></math></formula>. To understand how the digitization of 3D rigid
motions affects the topology and geometry of a chosen image patch, we
classify the rigid motions according to their effect on the image patch.
This classification can be described by an arrangement of hypersurfaces in
the parameter space of 3D rigid motions of dimension six. However, its high
dimensionality and the existence of degenerate cases make a direct
application of classical techniques, such as cylindrical algebraic
decomposition or critical point method, difficult. We show that this
problem can be first reduced to computing sample points in an arrangement
of quadrics in the 3D parameter space of rotations. Then we recover
information about the three remaining parameters of translation. We implemented
an ad-hoc variant of state-of-the-art algorithms and applied it to an
image patch of cardinality 7. This leads to an arrangement of 81 quadrics
and we recovered the classification in less than one hour on a machine
equipped with 40 cores <ref xlink:href="#vegas-2016-bid4" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>.</p>

        <p>Usually, the accuracy of parallel manipulators depends on the architecture
of the robot, the design parameters, the trajectory planning and the
location of the path in the workspace. This paper reports the influence of
static and dynamic parameters in computing the error in the pose
associated with the trajectory planning made and analyzed with the
Orthoglide 5-axis (Figure <ref xlink:href="#uid22" location="intern" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>). An error model is proposed based on the joint
parameters (velocity and acceleration) and experimental data coming from
the Orthoglide 5-axis. Newton and Gröbner based elimination methods are
used to project the joint error in the workspace to check the
accuracy/error in the Cartesian space. For the analysis, five similar
trajectories with different locations inside the workspace are defined
using fifth order polynomial equation for the trajectory planning. It is
shown that the accuracy of the robot depends on the location of the path
as well as the starting and the ending posture of the manipulator due to
the acceleration parameters <ref xlink:href="#vegas-2016-bid5" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>.</p>

        <p>In the context of our algorithm Isotop for computing the topology of plane algebraic curves (see
Section <ref xlink:href="#uid10" location="intern" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>), we work on the problem of solving a system of two bivariate polynomials.
We are interested in certified numerical approximations or, more precisely, isolating boxes of the
solutions. But we are also interested in computing, as intermediate symbolic objects, a Rational
Univariate Representation (RUR) that is, roughly speaking, a univariate polynomial and two rational
functions that map the roots of the univariate polynomial to the two coordinates of the
solutions of the system. RURs are relevant symbolic objects because
they allow to
the transformation of
many
queries on the system into queries on univariate polynomials.
However, such representations require the computation of a separating
form for the system, that is a linear combination of the variables that takes
different values when evaluated at the distinct solutions of the system.</p>
        <p>We published this year <ref xlink:href="#vegas-2016-bid1" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/> results showing that, given two polynomials of degree at most <formula type="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" overflow="scroll"><mi>d</mi></math></formula>

We also showed that these complexities are “morally” optimal in the sense of that improving them

        <p>We addressed the problem of finding the reflection point on quadric
mirror surfaces, especially ellipsoid, paraboloid or hyperboloid of two
sheets, of a light ray emanating from a 3D point
source <formula type="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" overflow="scroll"><msub><mi>P</mi><mn>1</mn></msub></math></formula> and going through another 3D point <formula type="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" overflow="scroll"><msub><mi>P</mi><mn>2</mn></msub></math></formula>, the camera center of projection.
We previously proposed a new algorithm for this

mirror and an ellipsoid with foci <formula type="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" overflow="scroll"><msub><mi>P</mi><mn>1</mn></msub></math></formula> and <formula type="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" overflow="scroll"><msub><mi>P</mi><mn>2</mn></msub></math></formula>.

Unfortunately, our new algorithm is not yet efficient in practice.
This year, we made several improvements on this algorithm. First, we decreased from 11 to 4 the
degree of a critical polynomial that we need to solve and whose solutions induce the coefficients in some other
polynomials appearing later in the computations. Second, we implemented Descartes' algorithm for
isolating the real roots of univariate polynomials in the case where the coefficients belong to
extensions of <formula type="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" overflow="scroll"><mi>ℚ</mi></math></formula> generated by at most two square roots.
Furthermore, we are currently implementing the generalization of that algorithm when the
coefficients belong to extensions of <formula type="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" overflow="scroll"><mi>ℚ</mi></math></formula> generated by one
root of an arbitrary polynomial.
We are also interested by extensions decomposable in extensions of degree 2.
These undergoing improvements should allow us to compute more directly the wanted reflection point, thus avoiding
problematic approximations and making the overall algorithm tractable.</p>

Bieberbach group or crystallographic group). We describe a geometric
criterion to check whether a partition of the manifold actually forms
a triangulation (which subsumes that it is a simplicial complex). We
provide an incremental algorithm to compute the Delaunay triangulation
of the manifold defined by a given set of input points, if it exists.
Otherwise, the algorithm returns the Delaunay triangulation of a
finite-sheeted covering space of the manifold. The algorithm has
optimal randomized worst-case time and space complexity. It extends to
closed Euclidean orbifolds. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first general result on this topic.</p>

        <p>Motivated by applications in various fields, some packages to compute
periodic Delaunay triangulations in the 2D and 3D Euclidean spaces
have been introduced in the <ref xlink:href="http://www.cgal.org" location="extern" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest">CGAL</ref> library and have attracted a number
of users. To the best of our knowledge, no software is available to
compute periodic triangulations in a hyperbolic space, though they are
also used in diverse fields, such as physics, solid modeling,
cosmological models, neuromathematics.</p>
        <p>This would be a natural extension: 2D Euclidean periodic
triangulations can be seen as triangulations of the two-dimensional
(flat) torus of genus one; similarly, periodic triangulations in the
hyperbolic plane can be seen as triangulations of hyperbolic
surfaces. A closed orientable hyperbolic surface is the quotient of
the hyperbolic plane under the action of a Fuchsian group only
containing hyperbolic translations. Intuition is challenged there, in particular
because such groups are non-Abelian in general.</p>
        <p>We have obtained some theoretical results on Delaunay triangulations
of general closed orientable hyperbolic
surfaces, and we have investigated
algorithms in the specific case of the Bolza surface, a hyperbolic
surface with the simplest possible topology, as it is homeomorphic to
a genus-two torus <ref xlink:href="#vegas-2016-bid9" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>. We are now studying more practical aspects

        <bodyTitle>Analysis of Farthest Point Sampling for Approximating Geodesics in a Graph</bodyTitle>
        <p>A standard way to approximate the distance between
two vertices <formula type="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" overflow="scroll"><mi>p</mi></math></formula> and <formula type="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" overflow="scroll"><mi>q</mi></math></formula> in a graph is to
compute
a shortest path from <formula type="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" overflow="scroll"><mi>p</mi></math></formula> to <formula type="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" overflow="scroll"><mi>q</mi></math></formula> that goes through one of <formula type="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" overflow="scroll"><mi>k</mi></math></formula> sources, which are well-chosen
vertices. Precomputing the distance between each of the <formula type="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" overflow="scroll"><mi>k</mi></math></formula> sources to all vertices
yields an efficient computation of approximate distances between any two vertices. One standard method for choosing <formula type="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" overflow="scroll"><mi>k</mi></math></formula> sources is the so-called <i>Farthest Point Sampling</i> (FPS), which starts with a random vertex as the first source, and iteratively selects the farthest vertex from the already selected sources.</p>
        <p>We analyzed the stretch factor <formula type="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" overflow="scroll"><msub><mi>ℱ</mi><mtext>FPS</mtext></msub></math></formula>
of approximate geodesics computed using FPS, which is the maximum, over all pairs of distinct
vertices, of their approximated distance over their geodesic distance in the graph. We showed that
<formula type="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" overflow="scroll"><msub><mi>ℱ</mi><mtext>FPS</mtext></msub></math></formula> can be bounded in terms of the minimal value <formula type="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" overflow="scroll"><msup><mi>ℱ</mi><mo>*</mo></msup></math></formula> of the
stretch factor obtained using an optimal placement of <formula type="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" overflow="scroll"><mi>k</mi></math></formula> sources as <formula type="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" overflow="scroll"><mrow><msub><mi>ℱ</mi><mtext>FPS</mtext></msub><mo>≤</mo><mn>2</mn><msubsup><mi>r</mi><mi>e</mi><mn>2</mn></msubsup><msup><mi>ℱ</mi><mo>*</mo></msup><mo>+</mo><mn>2</mn><msubsup><mi>r</mi><mi>e</mi><mn>2</mn></msubsup><mo>+</mo><mn>8</mn><msub><mi>r</mi><mi>e</mi></msub><mo>+</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></math></formula>, where <formula type="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" overflow="scroll"><msub><mi>r</mi><mi>e</mi></msub></math></formula> is the length ratio of
longest edge over the shortest edge in the graph.
We further showed that the factor <formula type="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" overflow="scroll"><msub><mi>r</mi><mi>e</mi></msub></math></formula>
is not an artefact of the analysis by providing a class of graphs for which

        <p>We say that a simplicial complex is shrinkable if there exists a sequence of
admissible edge contractions that reduces the complex to a single vertex. We
prove that it is NP-complete to decide whether a

        <p>The white ANR grant PRESAGE brings together computational geometers (from
the VEGAS and GEOMETRICA projects of Inria) and probabilistic
geometers (from Universities of Rouen, Orléans and Poitiers) to
tackle new probabilistic geometry problems arising from the design and
analysis of geometric algorithms and data structures. We focus on
properties of discrete structures induced by random
continuous geometric objects.</p>
        <p>The project, with a total budget of 400kE,

        <bodyTitle>ANR SingCAST</bodyTitle>
        <p>The objective of the young-researcher ANR grant SingCAST is to intertwine further
symbolic/numeric approaches to compute efficiently solution sets of polynomial
systems with topological and geometrical guarantees in singular cases. We
focus on two applications: the visualization of algebraic curves and surfaces
and the mechanical design of robots.</p>
        <p>After identifying classes of problems with restricted types of singularities,
we plan to develop dedicated symbolic-numerical methods that take advantage of
the structure of the associated polynomial systems that cannot be handled by
purely symbolic or numerical methods. Thus we plan to extend the class of
manipulators that can be analyzed, and the class of algebraic curves and
surfaces that can be visualized with certification.</p>
        <p>This is a 3.5 years project, with a total budget of 100kE, that started on
March 1st 2014, coordinated by Guillaume Moroz.</p>
        <p>The project funded the postdoc position of Rémi Imbach from November 2014 until
October 2016. We organized two workshops in 2016 with the OPTI team in
Nantes, on certified surface continuation.</p>

          <p>The objectives of the <i>ASsociate Team On Non-ISH
euclIdeaN Geometry</i> is to study various structures and algorithms in
non-Euclidean spaces, from a computational geometry
viewpoint. Proposing algorithms operating in such spaces requires a
prior deep study of the mathematical properties of the objects
considered, which raises new fundamental and difficult questions that
we want to tackle.</p>
          <p>A key characteristic of the project is its interdisciplinarity: it
gathers approaches, knowledge, and tools in mathematics and computer
science. A mathematical study of the considered objects will be
performed, together with the design of algorithms when
applicable. Algorithms will be analyzed both in theory and in practice
after prototype implementations. In the long term, implementations
should be improved whenever it makes sense to target longer-term
integrations into <ref xlink:href="http://www.cgal.org" location="extern" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest">CGAL</ref>, in order to disseminate our results to
end-users.</p>
          <p>The partners are the Johann Bernouilli Institute of Mathematics
