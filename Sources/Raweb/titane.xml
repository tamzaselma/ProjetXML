      <bodyTitle>General Presentation</bodyTitle>
      <p>Our overall objective is the computerized geometric modeling of complex scenes from physical measurements. On the geometric modeling and processing pipeline, this objective corresponds to steps required for conversion from physical to effective digital representations: <i>analysis</i>, <i>reconstruction</i> and <i>approximation</i>. Another longer term objective is the <i>synthesis</i> of complex scenes. This objective is related to analysis as we assume that the main sources of data are measurements, and synthesis is assumed to be carried out from samples.</p>
      <p>The related scientific challenges include i) being resilient to defect-laden data due to the uncertainty in the measurement processes and imperfect algorithms along the pipeline, ii) being resilient to heterogeneous data, both in type and in scale, iii) dealing with massive data, and iv) recovering or preserving the structure of complex scenes. We define the quality of a computerized representation by its i) geometric accuracy, or faithfulness to the physical scene, ii) complexity, iii) structure accuracy and control, and iv) amenability to effective processing and high level scene understanding.

      <bodyTitle>Context</bodyTitle>
      <p>Geometric modeling and processing revolve around three main end goals: a computerized shape representation that can be visualized (creating a realistic or artistic depiction), simulated (anticipating the real) or realized (manufacturing a conceptual or engineering design). Aside from the mere editing of geometry, central research themes in geometric modeling involve conversions between physical (real), discrete (digital), and mathematical (abstract) representations. Going from physical to digital is referred to as shape acquisition and reconstruction; going from mathematical to discrete is referred to as shape approximation and mesh generation; going from discrete to physical is referred to as shape rationalization.</p>
      <p>Geometric modeling has become an indispensable component for computational and reverse engineering. Simulations are now routinely performed on complex shapes issued not only from computer-aided design but also from an increasing amount of available measurements. The scale of acquired data is quickly growing: we no longer deal exclusively with individual shapes, but with entire <i>scenes</i>, possibly at the scale of entire cities, with many objects defined as structured shapes. We are witnessing a rapid evolution of the acquisition paradigms with an increasing variety of sensors and the development of community data, as well as disseminated data.</p>
      <p>In recent years, the evolution of acquisition technologies and methods has translated in an increasing overlap of algorithms and data in the computer vision, image processing, and computer graphics communities. Beyond the rapid increase of resolution through technological advances of sensors and methods for mosaicing images, the line between laser scan data and photos is getting thinner. Combining, e.g., laser scanners with panoramic cameras leads to massive 3D point sets with color attributes. In addition, it is now possible to generate dense point sets not just from laser scanners but also from photogrammetry techniques when using a well-designed acquisition protocol. Depth cameras are getting increasingly common, and beyond retrieving depth information we can enrich the main acquisition systems with additional hardware to measure geometric information about the sensor and improve data registration: e.g., accelerometers or <span class="smallcap" align="left">gps</span> for geographic location, and compasses or gyrometers for orientation. Finally, complex scenes can be observed at different scales ranging from satellite to pedestrian through aerial levels.</p>
      <p>These evolutions allow practitioners to measure urban scenes at resolutions that were until now possible only at the scale of individual shapes. The related scientific challenge is however more than just dealing with massive data sets coming from increase of resolution, as complex scenes are composed of multiple objects with structural relationships. The latter relate i) to the way the individual shapes are grouped to form objects, object classes or hierarchies, ii) to geometry when dealing with similarity, regularity, parallelism or symmetry, and iii) to domain-specific semantic considerations. Beyond reconstruction and approximation, consolidation and synthesis of complex scenes require rich structural relationships.</p>
      <p>The problems arising from these evolutions suggest that the strengths of geometry and images may be combined in the form of new methodological solutions such as photo-consistent reconstruction. In addition, the process of measuring the geometry of sensors (through gyrometers and accelerometers) often requires both geometry process and image analysis for improved accuracy and robustness. Modeling urban scenes from measurements illustrates this growing synergy, and it has become a central concern for a variety of applications ranging from urban planning to simulation through rendering and special effects.</p>
    </subsection>
    <subsection id="uid6" level="1">
      <bodyTitle>Analysis</bodyTitle>
      <p>Complex scenes are usually composed of a large number of objects which may significantly differ in terms of complexity, diversity, and density. These objects must be identified and their structural relationships must be recovered in order to model the scenes with improved robustness, low complexity, variable levels of details and ultimately, semantization (automated process of increasing degree of semantic content).</p>
      <p><i>Object classification</i> is an ill-posed task in which the objects composing a scene are detected and recognized with respect to predefined classes, the objective going beyond scene segmentation. The high variability in each class may explain the success of the stochastic approach which is able to model widely variable classes. As it requires a priori knowledge this process is often domain-specific such as for urban scenes where we wish to distinguish between instances as ground, vegetation and buildings. Additional challenges arise when each class must be refined, such as roof super-structures for urban reconstruction.</p>
      <p><i>Structure extraction</i> consists in recovering structural relationships between objects or parts of object. The structure may be related to adjacencies between objects, hierarchical decomposition, singularities or canonical geometric relationships. It is crucial for effective geometric modeling through levels of details or hierarchical multiresolution modeling. Ideally we wish to learn the structural rules that govern the physical scene manufacturing. Understanding the main canonical geometric relationships between object parts involves detecting regular structures and equivalences under certain transformations such as parallelism, orthogonality and symmetry. Identifying structural and geometric repetitions or symmetries is relevant for dealing with missing data during data consolidation.</p>
      <p><i>Data consolidation</i> is a problem of growing interest for practitioners, with the increase of heterogeneous and defect-laden data. To be exploitable, such defect-laden data must be consolidated by improving the data sampling quality and by reinforcing the geometrical and structural relations sub-tending the observed scenes. Enforcing canonical geometric relationships such as local coplanarity or orthogonality is relevant for registration of heterogeneous or redundant data, as well as for improving the robustness of the reconstruction process.</p>
    </subsection>
    <subsection id="uid7" level="1">
      <bodyTitle>Approximation</bodyTitle>
      <p>Our objective is to explore the approximation of complex shapes and scenes with surface and volume meshes, as well as on surface and domain tiling. A general way to state the shape approximation problem is to say that we search for the shape discretization (possibly with several levels of detail) that realizes the best complexity / distortion trade-off. Such a problem statement requires defining a discretization model, an error metric to measure distortion as well as a way to measure complexity. The latter is most commonly expressed in number of polygon primitives, but other measures closer to information theory lead to measurements such as number of bits or minimum description length.</p>
      <p>For surface meshes we intend to conceive methods which provide control and guarantees both over the global approximation error and over the validity of the embedding. In addition, we seek for resilience to heterogeneous data, and robustness to noise and outliers. This would allow repairing and simplifying triangle soups with cracks, self-intersections and gaps. Another exploratory objective is to deal generically with different error metrics such as the symmetric Hausdorff distance, or a Sobolev norm which mixes errors in geometry and normals.</p>
      <p>For surface and domain tiling the term meshing is substituted for tiling to stress the fact that tiles may be not just simple elements, but can model complex smooth shapes such as bilinear quadrangles. Quadrangle surface tiling is central for the so-called <i>resurfacing</i> problem in reverse engineering: the goal is to tile an input raw surface geometry such that the union of the tiles approximates the input well and such that each tile matches certain properties related to its shape or its size. In addition, we may require parameterization domains with a simple structure. Our goal is to devise surface tiling algorithms that are both reliable and resilient to defect-laden inputs, effective from the shape approximation point of view, and with flexible control upon the structure of the tiling.</p>
    </subsection>
    <subsection id="uid8" level="1">
      <bodyTitle>Reconstruction</bodyTitle>
      <p>Assuming a geometric dataset made out of points or slices, the process of shape reconstruction amounts to recovering a surface or a solid that matches these samples. This problem is inherently ill-posed as infinitely-many shapes may fit the data. One must thus regularize the problem and add priors such as simplicity or smoothness of the inferred shape.</p>
      <p>The concept of geometric simplicity has led to a number of interpolating techniques commonly based upon the Delaunay triangulation. The concept of smoothness has led to a number of approximating techniques that commonly compute an implicit function such that one of its isosurfaces approximates the inferred surface. Reconstruction algorithms can also use an explicit set of prior shapes for inference by assuming that the observed data can be described by these predefined prior shapes. One key lesson learned in the shape problem is that there is probably not a single solution which can solve all cases, each of them coming with its own distinctive features. In addition, some data sets such as point sets acquired on urban scenes are very domain-specific and require a dedicated line of research.</p>
      <p>In recent years the <i>smooth, closed case</i> (i.e., shapes without sharp features nor boundaries) has received considerable attention. However, the state-of-the-art methods have several shortcomings: in addition to being in general not robust to outliers and not sufficiently robust to noise, they often require additional attributes as input, such as lines of sight or oriented normals. We wish to devise shape reconstruction methods which are both geometrically and topologically accurate without requiring additional attributes, while exhibiting resilience to defect-laden inputs. Resilience formally translates into stability with respect to noise and outliers. Correctness of the reconstruction translates into convergence in geometry and (stable parts of) topology of the reconstruction with respect to the inferred shape known through measurements.</p>
      <p>Moving from the smooth, closed case to the <i>piecewise smooth case</i> (possibly with boundaries) is considerably harder as the ill-posedness of the problem applies to each sub-feature of the inferred shape. Further, very few approaches tackle the combined issue of robustness (to sampling defects, noise and outliers) and feature reconstruction.

      <bodyTitle>Applications</bodyTitle>
      <p>In addition to tackling enduring scientific challenges, our research on geometric modeling and processing is motivated by applications to computational engineering, reverse engineering, digital mapping and urban planning.
The main deliverable of our research will be algorithms with theoretical foundations. Ultimately we wish to contribute making geometry modeling and processing routine for practitioners who deal with real-world data. Our contributions may also be used as a sound basis for future software and technology developments.</p>
      <p>Our first ambition for technology transfer is to consolidate the components of our research experiments in the form of new software components for the CGAL (Computational Geometry Algorithms Library) library. Through CGAL we wish to contribute to the âstandard geometric toolboxâ, so as to provide a generic answer to application needs instead of fragmenting our contributions. We already cooperate with the Inria spin-off company Geometry Factory, which commercializes CGAL, maintains it and provide technical support.</p>
      <p>Our second ambition is to increase the research momentum of companies through advising Cifre Ph.D. theses and postdoctoral fellows on topics that match our research program.</p>

      <bodyTitle>MeshMantics</bodyTitle>
      <p>This software component implements an approach that reconstructs 3D urban scenes in the form of levels of detail (LODs). Starting from raw data sets such as surface meshes generated by multi-view stereo systems, the algorithm proceeds in three main steps: classification, abstraction and reconstruction. From geometric attributes and a set of semantic rules combined with a Markov random field, we classify the scene into four meaningful classes. The abstraction step detects and regularizes planar structures on buildings, fits icons on trees, roofs and facades, and performs filtering and simplification for LOD generation. The abstracted data are then provided as input to the reconstruction step which generates watertight buildings through a min-cut formulation on a set of 3D arrangements.</p>

The main difference in output is that this method reconstructs a surface that interpolates the point set (as opposed to approximating the point set).

        <p>We contributed a supervised machine learning approach for classification of objects from sampled point data. The main idea consists in first abstracting the input object into planar parts at several scales, then discriminate between the different classes of objects solely through features derived from these planar shapes. Abstracting into planar shapes provides a means to both reduce the computational complexity and improve robustness to defects inherent to the acquisition process. Measuring statistical properties and relationships between planar shapes offers invariance to scale and orientation. A random forest is then used for solving the multiclass classification problem. We demonstrate the potential of our approach on a set of indoor objects from the Princeton shape benchmark and on objects acquired from indoor scenes and compare the performance of our method with other point-based shape descriptors <ref xlink:href="#titane-2016-bid1" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>.

        <p>Vector drawing is a popular representation in graphic design because of the precision, compactness and editability offered by parametric curves. However, prior work on line drawing vectorization focused solely on faithfully capturing input bitmaps, and largely overlooked the problem of producing a compact and editable curve network. As a result, existing algorithms tend to produce overly-complex drawings composed of many short curves and control points, especially in the presence of thick or sketchy lines that yield spurious curves at junctions. We propose the first vectorization algorithm that explicitly balances fidelity to the input bitmap with simplicity of the output, as measured by the number of curves and their degree. By casting this trade-off as a global optimization, our algorithm generates few yet accurate curves, and also disambiguates curve topology at junctions by favoring the simplest interpretations overall. We demonstrate the robustness of our algorithm on a variety of drawings, sketchy cartoons and rough design sketches (See Figure <ref xlink:href="#uid43" location="intern" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>).

        <p>Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) were initially conceived for image categorization, i.e., the problem of assigning a semantic label to an entire input image. We have address the problem of dense semantic labeling, which consists in assigning a semantic label to <i>every</i> pixel in an image. Since this requires a high spatial accuracy to determine <i>where</i> labels are assigned, categorization CNNs, intended to be highly robust to local deformations, are not directly applicable.
By adapting categorization networks, many semantic labeling CNNs have been recently proposed. Our first contribution is an in-depth analysis of these architectures. We establish the desired properties of an ideal semantic labeling CNN, and assess how those methods stand with regard to these properties. We observe that even though they provide competitive results, these CNNs often do not leverage properties of semantic labeling that could lead to more effective and efficient architectures.
Out of these observations, we then derive a CNN framework specifically adapted to the semantic labeling problem <ref xlink:href="#titane-2016-bid3" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>. In addition to learning features at different resolutions, it learns how to combine these features. By integrating local and global information in an efficient and flexible manner, it outperforms previous techniques. We evaluate the proposed framework and compare it with state-of-the-art architectures on public benchmarks of high-resolution aerial image labeling.</p>

        <p>While initially devised for image categorization, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are being increasingly used for the pixelwise semantic labeling of images. However, the proper nature of the most common CNN architectures makes them good at recognizing but poor at localizing objects precisely. This problem is magnified in the context of aerial and satellite image labeling, where a spatially fine object outlining is of paramount importance.</p>
        <p>Different iterative enhancement algorithms have been presented in the literature to progressively improve the coarse CNN outputs, seeking to sharpen object boundaries around real image edges. However, one must carefully design, choose and tune such algorithms. Instead, our goal is to directly learn the iterative process itself. For this, we formulate a generic iterative enhancement process inspired from partial differential equations, and observe that it can be expressed as a recurrent neural network (RNN). Consequently, we train such a network from manually labeled data for our enhancement task. In a series of experiments we show that our RNN effectively learns an iterative process that significantly improves the quality of satellite image classification maps <ref xlink:href="#titane-2016-bid4" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>.</p>

        <p>We propose an end-to-end framework for the dense, pixelwise classification of satellite imagery with convolutional neural networks (CNNs). In our framework, CNNs are directly trained to produce classification maps out of the input images. We first devise a <i>fully convolutional</i> architecture and demonstrate its relevance to the dense classification problem. We then address the issue of imperfect training data through a two-step training approach: CNNs are first initialized by using a large amount of possibly inaccurate reference data, then refined on a small amount of accurately labeled data. To complete our framework we design a multi-scale neuron module that alleviates the common trade-off between recognition and precise localization. A series of experiments show that our networks take into account a large amount of context to provide fine-grained classification maps.

        <p>We propose a convolutional neural network (CNN) model for remote sensing image classification, i.e. the assignment of a class to every pixel in an image. Using CNNs provides us with a means of learning contextual features for large-scale image labeling. Our network consists of four stacked convolutional layers that downsample the image and extract relevant features. On top of these, a deconvolutional layer upsamples the data back to the initial resolution, producing a final dense image labeling. Contrary to previous frameworks, our architecture is a fully convolutional network (FCN), contains only convolution and deconvolution operations and no fully connected layers as in previous work. The fact of being fully convolutional removes the artifacts present in previous work by construction and is considerably more efficient. Experiments on aerial images show that our network produces more accurate classifications in lower computational time.

        <p>The representation of images with binary partition trees (BPTs) has proven to be very efficient for multiscale analysis, object detection and classification of high-resolution images. We propose a new framework for multi-class image segmentation using a binary partition tree. The region model is composed of three components : color component, probability component and shape component, some of which can be used or omitted depending on the information available and the application itself. The problem to extract a segmentation is formulated as the minimization of an energy function which can be solved with dynamical programming efficiently. However, BPT represents a hierarchy of the image regions at different scales. For large-scale images such representation can be demanding in terms of both memory and computation resources. We propose a tile-based scheme to extend the framework for processing arbitrarily large images. Experiments (see Fig.Â <ref xlink:href="#uid53" location="intern" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>) prove that the algorithm can segment large images efficiently while ensuring quite similar results with respect to processing the whole image at once.

        <p>Automatic city modeling from satellite imagery is one of the biggest challenges in urban reconstruction. Existing methods produce at best rough and dense Digital Surface Models. Inspired by recent works on semantic 3D reconstruction and region-based stereovision, we propose a method for producing compact, semantic-aware and geometrically accurate 3D city models from stereo pair of satellite images <ref xlink:href="#titane-2016-bid7" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>. Our approach relies on two key ingredients. First, geometry and semantics are retrieved simultaneously bringing robustness to occlusions and to low image quality. Second, we operate at the scale of geometric atomic region which allows the shape of urban objects to be well preserved, and a gain in scalability and efficiency. We demonstrate the potential of our algorithm by reconstructing different cities around the world in a few minutes (See Figure <ref xlink:href="#uid56" location="intern" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>).

        <p>The area of surface reconstruction has seen substantial progress in the past two decades. The traditional problem addressed by surface reconstruction is to recover the digital representation of a physical shape that has been scanned, where the scanned data contains a wide variety of defects. While much of the earlier work has been focused on reconstructing a piece-wise smooth representation of the original shape, recent work has taken on more specialized priors to address significantly challenging data imperfections, where the reconstruction can take on different representations â not necessarily the explicit geometry. We survey the field of surface reconstruction, and provide a categorization with respect to priors, data imperfections, and reconstruction output. By considering a holistic view of surface reconstruction, we show a detailed characterization of the field, highlight similarities between diverse reconstruction techniques, and provide directions for future work in surface reconstruction.

        <p>We contribute a reliable line/surface intersection method for trimmed NURBS surfaces, based on a novel matrix-based implicit representation and numerical methods in linear algebra such as singular value decomposition and the computation of generalized eigenvalues and eigenvectors. A careful treatment of degenerate cases makes our approach robust to intersection points with multiple pre-images. We then apply our intersection algorithm to seamlessly mesh NURBS surfaces through Delaunay refinement (see Figure <ref xlink:href="#uid60" location="intern" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>). We demonstrate the added value of our approach in terms of accuracy and treatment of degenerate cases, by providing comparisons with other intersection approaches as well as a variety of meshing experiments.

        <p>We contribute a variational method to generate cell complexes with local anisotropy conforming to the Hessian of any given convex function and for any given local mesh density. Our formulation builds upon approximation theory to offer an anisotropic extension of Centroidal Voronoi Tessellations which can be seen as a dual form of Optimal Delaunay Triangulation. We thus refer to the resulting anisotropic polytopal meshes as Optimal Voronoi Tessellations. Our approach sharply contrasts with previous anisotropic versions of Voronoi diagrams as it employs first-type Bregman diagrams, a generalization of power diagrams where sites are augmented with not only a scalar-valued weight but also a vector-valued shift. As such, our OVT meshes contain only convex cells with straight edges (Figure <ref xlink:href="#uid62" location="intern" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>), and admit an embedded dual triangulation that is combinatorially-regular. We show the effectiveness of our technique using off-the-shelf computational geometry libraries.

        <p>We formulate an automatic approach to the detection of partial, local, and global symmetries and orbits in arbitrary 3D datasets. We improve upon existing voting-based symmetry detection techniques by leveraging the Lie group structure of geometric transformations. In particular, we introduce a logarithmic mapping that ensures that orbits are mapped to linear subspaces, hence unifying and extending many existing mappings in a single Lie-algebra voting formulation (Figure <ref xlink:href="#uid64" location="intern" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>). Compared to previous work, our resulting method offers significantly improved robustness as it guarantees that our symmetry detection of an input model is frame, scale, and reflection invariant. As a consequence, we demonstrate that our approach efficiently and reliably discovers symmetries and orbits of geometric datasets without requiring heavy parameter tuning. This work was published in the proceedings of the EUROGRAPHICS Symposium on Geometry Processing <ref xlink:href="#titane-2016-bid0" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>.</p>

          <caption>Our Lie algebra voting approach to symmetry and orbit detection maps SE(3) transformations into points in a logarithmic space composed of a rotation part and a translation part. The rotational orbit of the church and the translational orbit of the side railing (a) are mapped into collinear blue and red spheres respectively (a few transformations within these two orbits are marked with circled numbers to enhance comprehension). When the scene is centered, the two lines are orthogonal to each other and easy to distinguish (b). However, after a rigid translation of the scene, the rotational orbit now has translation-values near the translation orbit points, making it impossible to automatically distinguish these two orbits using a Euclidean distance (d), while our adjoint invariant distance for orbit shows no discernible difference in results as evidenced by a binning of detected orbit sizes for both situations (e).</caption>

        <p>The aim of this collaboration is to devise a new type of 2.5D representation from satellite multi-view stereo images which is more accurate, compact and meaningful than the conventional digital elevation models (DEMs). A key direction consists in incorporating semantic information directly during the image matching process. This semantic is related to the type of components of the scene, such as vegetation, roofs, building edges, roads and land.</p>

The demonstrator will include novel approaches resulting from the ERC-funded IRON project (Robust Geometry Processing, StG-2010-257474), which are illustrated by publications presented at premier conferences in our field and a patent submitted in 2015. The expected outcomes of TITANIUM will be versatile methods for 3D reconstruction and simplification of data gathered from geometric measurements, as well as related methods specifically tailored to urban modeling. These methods represent a significant step forward by offering unrivaled levels of robustness, and automated generation of levels of detail that are semantically meaningful. The acronym TITANIUM, a robust and lightweight material, conveys our wish to streamline the geometric modeling pipeline through robust algorithms and lightweight representations. This Proof of Concept project will also implement the steps required for pre-commercialization. In view of this goal, we have included an industrial partner, GeometryFactory, a spinoff from Inria. We have already established preliminary contacts in the fields of metrology and geographic information systems. These contacts will provide real-world industrial case studies.</p>
