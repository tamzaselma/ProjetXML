      <bodyTitle>Logic and Graph-based KR</bodyTitle>
      <p>The main research domain of GraphIK is Knowledge Representation and Reasoning
(KR), which studies paradigms and formalisms for representing knowledge and
reasoning on these representations. We follow a logic-oriented approach: the
different kinds of knowledge have a logical semantics and reasoning
mechanisms correspond to inferences in this logic. However, in the field of
logic-based KR, we distinguish ourselves by also using graphs and
hypergraphs (in the graph-theoretic sense) as basic objects. Indeed, we view
labelled graphs as an <i>abstract representation</i> of knowledge that can be
expressed in many KR languages: different kinds of conceptual graphs
—historically our main focus—, the Semantic Web language RDFS, expressive
rules equivalent to the so-called tuple-generating-dependencies in databases,
some description logics dedicated to query answering, etc.
For these languages, reasoning can be based
on the structure of objects (thus on graph-theoretic notions), with homomorphism as a core notion, while being sound and complete with respect to entailment in the associated logical fragments.
An important issue is to study <i>trade-offs</i> between the expressivity
and computational tractability of (sound and complete) reasoning in these
languages.</p>

    <subsection id="uid19" level="1">
      <bodyTitle>Logic-based Knowledge Representation and Reasoning</bodyTitle>
      <p>We follow the mainstream <i>logic-based</i> approach to the KR
domain.
First-order logic (FOL) is the reference logic in KR
and most formalisms in this area can be translated into fragments (i.e.,
particular subsets) of FOL. This is in particular the case for
description logics and existential rules, two well-known KR formalisms
studied in the team.</p>
      <p>A large part of research in this domain
can be seen as studying the <i>trade-off</i> between the expressivity of
languages and the complexity of (sound and complete) reasoning in
these languages. The fundamental problem in KR languages is
entailment checking: is a given
piece of knowledge entailed by other pieces of knowledge, for instance from a
knowledge base (KB)? Another important problem is <i>consistency</i>
checking: is a set of knowledge pieces (for instance the knowledge base
itself) consistent, i.e., is it sure that nothing absurd can be entailed from
it? The <i>ontology-mediated query answering</i> problem is a topical problem
(see Section <ref xlink:href="#uid21" location="intern" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>). It asks for the
set of answers to a query in the KB. In the case of Boolean queries (i.e.,
queries with a yes/no answer), it can be recast as entailment checking.
</p>
    </subsection>
    <subsection id="uid20" level="1">
      <bodyTitle>Graph-based Knowledge Representation and Reasoning</bodyTitle>
      <p>Besides logical foundations, we are interested in KR formalisms
that comply, or aim at complying with the following requirements:
to have good <i>computational</i> properties and to allow users of
knowledge-based systems to have a maximal <i>understanding and
control</i> over each step of the knowledge base building process and
use.</p>
      <p>These two requirements are the core motivations for our graph-based approach
to KR.
We view labelled graphs as an <i>abstract representation</i>
of knowledge that can be expressed in many KR languages
(different kinds of conceptual graphs —historically our main focus—, the
Semantic Web language RDF (Resource Description Framework), its extension
RDFS (RDF Schema), expressive rules equivalent to the so-called
tuple-generating-dependencies in databases, some description logics
dedicated
to query answering, etc.). For these languages, reasoning can be based on the
structure of objects, thus based on graph-theoretic notions, while staying
logically founded.</p>
      <p>More precisely, our basic objects are labelled graphs (or hypergraphs)
representing entities and relationships between these entities. These graphs
have a natural translation in first-order logic. Our basic reasoning tool is
graph homomorphism. The fundamental property is that graph homomorphism is
sound and complete with respect to logical entailment <i>i.e.</i>, given two
(labelled) graphs <formula type="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" overflow="scroll"><mi>G</mi></math></formula> and <formula type="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" overflow="scroll"><mi>H</mi></math></formula>, there is a homomorphism from <formula type="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" overflow="scroll"><mi>G</mi></math></formula> to <formula type="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" overflow="scroll"><mi>H</mi></math></formula>
<i>if and only if</i> the formula assigned to <formula type="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" overflow="scroll"><mi>G</mi></math></formula> is entailed by the formula
assigned to <formula type="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" overflow="scroll"><mi>H</mi></math></formula>. In other words, logical reasoning on these graphs can be
performed by graph mechanisms. These knowledge constructs and the associated
reasoning mechanisms can be extended (to represent rules for instance) while
keeping this fundamental correspondence between graphs and logics.
</p>
    </subsection>
    <subsection id="uid21" level="1">
      <bodyTitle>Ontology-Mediated Query Answering</bodyTitle>
      <p>Querying knowledge bases has become a central problem in knowledge
representation and in databases. A knowledge base (KB) is classically
composed of a terminological part (metadata, ontology) and an assertional
part (facts, data). Queries are supposed to be at least as expressive as the
basic queries in databases, i.e.,
conjunctive queries, which can be seen as existentially closed conjunctions of atoms
or as labelled graphs.
The challenge is to define good trade-offs between the expressivity of the
ontological language and the complexity of querying data in presence of
ontological knowledge. Description logics have been so far the prominent family
of formalisms for representing and reasoning with ontological knowledge.
However, classical description
logics were not designed for efficient data querying. On the other hand, database
languages are able to process complex queries on huge databases, but without
taking the ontology into account. There is thus a need for new languages and
mechanisms, able to cope with the ever growing size of knowledge bases in the
Semantic Web or in scientific domains.</p>
      <p>This problem is related to two other problems identified as fundamental in KR:</p>
      <simplelist>
        <li id="uid22">
          <p noindent="true"><i>Query-answering with incomplete information.</i>
Incomplete information means that it might be unknown whether a given assertion
is true or false. Databases classically make the so-called
closed-world assumption: every fact that cannot be retrieved or
inferred from the base is assumed to be false. Knowledge bases
classically make the open-world assumption: if something cannot be
inferred from the base, and neither can its negation, then its truth
status is unknown. The need of coping with incomplete information
is a distinctive feature of querying knowledge
bases with respect to querying classical databases
(however, as explained above, this
distinction tends to disappear). The presence of incomplete
information makes the query answering task much more difficult.</p>
        </li>
        <li id="uid23">
          <p noindent="true"><i>Reasoning with rules. </i>
Researching types of rules and adequate manners to process them is a
mainstream topic in the Semantic Web, and, more generally a crucial issue
for knowledge-based systems. For several years, we have been studying some
rules, both in their logical and their graph form, which are syntactically
very simple but also very expressive. These rules, known as existential
rules or Datalog<formula type="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" overflow="scroll"><mo>+</mo></math></formula>, can be seen as an abstraction of ontological knowledge
expressed in the main languages used in the context of KB querying. See
Section <ref xlink:href="#uid55" location="intern" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/> for details on the results
obtained.</p>
        </li>
      </simplelist>
      <p>A problem generalizing the above described problems, and particularly
relevant in the context of multiple data/metadata sources, is <i>querying
hybrid knowledge bases</i>. In a hybrid knowledge base, each component may have
its own formalism and its own reasoning mechanisms. There may be a common
ontology shared by all components, or each component may have its own
ontology, with mappings being defined among the ontologies. The question is
what kind of interactions between these components and/or what limitations on
the languages preserve the decidability of basic problems and if so, a
“reasonable”complexity. Note that there are strong connections with the
issue of data integration in databases.</p>
    </subsection>
    <subsection id="uid24" level="1">
      <bodyTitle>Imperfect Information and Priorities</bodyTitle>
      <p>While classical FOL is the kernel of many KR languages, to solve real-world
problems we often need to consider features that cannot be expressed purely (or not naturally)
in classical logic. The logic- and graph-based formalisms used for previous points have thus to be extended
with such features.The following requirements have been identified from scenarios in decision
making in the agronomy domain.</p>
      <orderedlist>
        <li id="uid25">
          <p noindent="true">to cope with vague and uncertain information and preferences in queries;</p>
        </li>
        <li id="uid26">
          <p noindent="true">to cope with multi-granularity knowledge;</p>
        </li>
        <li id="uid27">
          <p noindent="true">to take into account different and potentially conflicting viewpoints ;</p>
        </li>
        <li id="uid28">
          <p noindent="true">to integrate decision notions (priorities, gravity, risk, benefit);</p>
        </li>
        <li id="uid29">
          <p noindent="true">to integrate argumentation-based reasoning.</p>
        </li>
      </orderedlist>
      <p>Although the solutions we develop need to be validated on the applications
that motivated them, we also want them to be sufficiently generic to be
applied in other contexts. One angle of attack (but not the only possible
one) consists in increasing the expressivity of our core languages, while
trying to preserve their essential combinatorial properties, so that
algorithmic optimizations can be transferred to these extensions.</p>

      <p>Ontolology-mediated query answering (and more generally <i>Ontology-Based
Data Access</i>, <i>OBDA</i>) is a recent paradigm in data management, which takes
into account inferences enabled by an ontology when querying data. In other
words, the notion of a database is replaced by that of a knowledge base,
composed of data (also called facts) and of an ontology.
Two families of formalisms for representing and reasoning with the ontological
component are considered in this context: <i>description logics</i>
and the more recent <i>existential rule</i> framework.
Until last year, the team has mainly investigated existential rules.
This expressive formalism
generalizes most lightweight description logics used in OBDA (such as <formula type="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" overflow="scroll"><mi>ℰℒ</mi></math></formula> and
DL-Lite, on which OWL 2 tractable profiles are based) on the one hand, and Datalog, the language of
deductive databases, on the other hand.
With the arrival of Meghyn Bienvenu,
description logics have joined the core formalisms studied by the team.
Compared to existential rules, the description logics considered for OBDA
lead to lower complexity classes and specific algorithmic techniques.
Studying both formalisms is scientifically highly relevant, specially in the context of OBDA.</p>
      <p>We have also broadened this research line
by starting investigating ontological languages for non-relational data,
an issue that has barely been considered yet.</p>
      <p>Before presenting this year' results, we recall the two classical ways of
processing rules, namely forward chaining and backward chaining. In
forward chaining (also known as the <i>chase</i> in databases),
the rules are applied to enrich the initial facts and query
answering can then be solved by evaluating the query against the
“saturated” factbase (as in a classical database system <i>i.e.</i>, with
forgetting the rules). The backward chaining process can be divided into two
steps: first, the initial query is rewritten using the rules into a
first-order query (typically a union of conjunctive queries, UCQ); then the
rewritten query is evaluated against the initial factbase (again, as in a
classical database system). Note that forward and backward processes
do not halt for all kinds of existential rules nor all lightweight description logics.</p>
      <subsection id="uid56" level="2">
        <bodyTitle>New Results in the Description Logics Framework</bodyTitle>
        <p>When using Description Logics (DL) ontologies to access relational data, mappings are used to link the relational schema to the vocabulary of the ontology (which uses only unary and binary predicates). In order to debug and optimize DL-based OBDA systems, it is important to be able to analyze and compare ontology-mapping pairs, called OBDA specifications. Prior work in this direction compared specifications using classical notions of equivalence and entailment.</p>

          <li id="uid57">
            <p noindent="true">We have explored an alternative approach in which two specifications are deemed equivalent if they give the same answers to the considered query or class of queries for all possible data sources.

This led us to study FO-rewritability of conjunctive queries in the presence of ontologies formulated in DLs ranging between <formula type="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" overflow="scroll"><mi>ℰℒ</mi></math></formula> and Horn-<formula type="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" overflow="scroll"><mi>𝒮ℋℐℱ</mi></math></formula>, along with related query containment problems. Apart from providing characterizations, we established complexity results ranging from EXPTIME via NEXPTIME to 2EXPTIME, pointing out several interesting effects. In particular, FO-rewriting is more complex for conjunctive queries than for atomic queries when inverse roles are present, but not otherwise.</p>

by pinpointing the (data and combined) complexities of evaluating path queries (more precisely, two-way regular path queries) over knowledge bases whose ontology is composed of linear existential rules (a class of rules that can be seen as a natural generalisation of the description logic DL-Lite<formula type="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" overflow="scroll"><msub><mrow/><mi>ℛ</mi></msub></math></formula>).

One of our first results is that, for a natural notion of boundedness, bounded existential rules are exactly those at the intersection of finite expansion sets (which ensure that any factbase has a finite sound and complete saturation) and finite unification sets (which ensure that any conjunctive query can be finitely rewritten into a sound and complete union of conjunctive queries).</p>

        <bodyTitle>Querying NoSQL databases (Key-value stores)</bodyTitle>
        <p>Over the last decade, research efforts to develop algorithms for OBDA have built on the assumption that data conforms to relational structures (including RDF) and that the paradigm can be deployed on top of relational databases with conjunctive queries at the core (e.g., in SQL or SPARQL). However, this is not the prominent way on which data is today stored and exchanged, especially in the Web. Whether OBDA can be developed for non-relational structures, like those shared by increasingly popular NOSQL languages sustaining Big-Data analytics, is still an open question. In collaboration with Marie-Christine Rousset (University of Grenoble, LIG), we proposed the first framework for studying the problem of answering ontology-mediated queries on top of NOSQL key-value stores. More precisely, we formalized the core data model and basic queries of these
systems and introduced a rule language (NO-RL) to express lightweight ontologies on top of data. We defined a sound and complete query rewriting technique and studied the decidability and data complexity of answering ontology-mediated queries depending on considered the rule fragment.</p>

      <p>Inconsistency-Tolerant Query Answering is one of the challenging problems that received a lot of attention in recent years as inconsistency may arise in practical applications due to several reasons: merging, integration, revision. In the context of Ontology-Based Data Access (OBDA), where the ontological knowledge is assumed to be coherent and fully reliable, inconsistency comes from the data, i.e., occurs when some assertional facts contradict some constraints
imposed by the ontological knowledge. Existing works in this area have studied different inconsistency-tolerant query answering techniques, called “semantics”: some examples include Brave, IAR, ICR, AR etc..These proposals are closely related to works on querying inconsistent databases, or inference from inconsistent propositional logic knowledge bases.</p>
      <p>The work of this year on inconsistency-tolerant query answering techniques for Ontology Based Data Access focused on (i) new results about different kinds of semantics or (ii) the user interaction with such semantics (we investigated the notion of repair based explanation or argumentation based explanation). We have investigated the interest of inconsistency-tolerant semantics in general and argumentation techniques for the agrifood chain in particular.</p>

        <bodyTitle>Inconsistency-Tolerant Semantics for Query Answering</bodyTitle>
        <p>In all approaches considered here, a knowledge base can have, in opposition to the logics studied in <ref xlink:href="#uid55" location="intern" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>, several incompatible “minimal” models. Those models can correspond to possible repairs of an inconsistent knowledge base or can be the models generated by a non-monotonic logic. The questions we address here are linked to the semantics (how to define those models, how to define preferences on those models), while trying to preserve a satisfying trade-off between expressivity and computational complexity of the querying mechanism.</p>
        <simplelist>
          <li id="uid71">
            <p noindent="true">We proposed a new inconsistency-tolerant inference relation, called non-objection inference, where a query is considered as valid if it is entailed by at least one repair and it is consistent with all the other repairs. The main salient points of the newly introduced semantics is its efficiency (query answering with non-objection inference is achieved in polynomial time) and the fact that the inferences are strictly more productive than universal inference while preserving the consistency of its set of conclusions. The intuition behind is that no repair has an objection veto to the acceptance of the query. If query entailment from repairs is seen as posing a vote for, against or abstaining to a query then, in this semantics, some repairs are “voting” for a query (i.e., the query is entailed) and the rest of the repairs are not against (i.e., the query body atoms together with the atoms in the repair are consistent with the terminology) then the query is accepted without any objection. In addition, two variants of non-objection inference based on a selection of repairs (that can be against a query) are also considered.</p>

We further proposed a new TPI-like dialectical proof theory (a procedure where two players exchange arguments (moves) until one of them cannot play) for universal acceptance (i.e.,AR semantics).

            <p noindent="true">Several inconsistency-tolerant semantics have been introduced for querying inconsistent knowledge bases. In order for users to be able to understand the query results, it is crucial to be able to explain why a tuple is a (non-)answer to a query under such semantics. We defined explanations for positive and negative answers under the brave, AR and IAR semantics. We then studied the computational properties of explanations in the lightweight description logic DL-Lite<formula type="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" overflow="scroll"><msub><mrow/><mi>R</mi></msub></math></formula>. For each type of explanation, we analyzed the data complexity of recognizing (preferred) explanations and deciding if a given assertion is relevant or necessary. We established tight connections between intractable explanation problems and variants of propositional satisfiability (SAT), enabling us to generate explanations by exploiting solvers for Boolean satisfaction and optimization problems. Finally, we empirically studied the efficiency of our explanation framework using the well-established LUBM benchmark.</p>

The aim is to find a set of data modifications (deletions and additions), called a repair plan, that addresses as many of the defects as possible. After formalizing this problem and introducing different notions of optimality, we investigated the computational complexity of reasoning about optimal repair plans and proposed interactive algorithms for computing such plans. For deletion-only repair plans, we also presented a prototype implementation of the core components of the algorithm.</p>

We demonstrated how to benefit from structured argumentation frameworks in practice by means of their implementations.

        <p>The evaluation output considers 12 different cases split in 5 major link categories: valid, almost valid, erroneous, missing, doubtful. For the 3 latter categories, we can often provide a correction or completion proposal.</p>
        <p>We have initially implemented this application as a standalone client written in Java (see Section <ref xlink:href="#uid38" location="intern" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>). We have tested it on a benchmark comprising 550 links, for which the evaluation has been done by experts. Our application has obtained very good results, since more than 70% of the links are evaluated correctly, less than 1% wrongly, and the rest consists of links for which data is insufficient to provide an evaluation.</p>
        <p>To allow professionals from ABES to use this application, we have developed an interactive web service: the user first asks for the evaluation output on the set of links induced by a subset of contextual references; then he can validate or invalidate the proposed correction/completion. The tool can be restarted after each correction/completion to improve the evaluation with this new data. Our ABES partner is currently developing an enhanced graphical interface for Sudoc users, that will communicate with that web service, in order to use the software in production conditions.</p>
        <p>Finally, an evaluation of the time required by our application led to numerous optimizations. We have for now concluded that the time is essentially spent by the library functions computing similarities between attributes. We consider now using map/reduce techniques to parallelize those computations.</p>

        <p>Beside, we studied the use of the <tt>owl:sameAs</tt> property (expressing that two URIs actually refer to the same thing) in practice. Many existing identity links do not reflect genuine real identity and therefore might lead to inconsistencies. We formalized explanation dialogues that use argument-based explanation based on inconsistency-tolerant semantics, and showed how to support a domain expert in discovering inconsistencies due to erroneous <tt>SameAs</tt> links. We implemented a prototype of the explanation dialogue that communicates with our tool Graal and provided an example of <tt>sameAs</tt> invalidation over real data explaining what has been obtained while running dialogues and how such results might benefit domain experts.</p>

        <p>In the framework of a contract between INRA IATE and STLO (Rennes) research units and Régilait, two master students have been recruited in 2016. Marine Damblon, food engineer from Polytech Montpellier, has created a knowledge base
which represents the causal links between a food descriptor (mouillabilité des poudres de lait) and actions which can be undertaken by operators to control food quality on the line. Justine Flore Tchouanguem participated to the development
of the new CoGui-Capex version presented in section <ref xlink:href="#uid52" location="intern" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>. CoGui-Capex prototype has been successfully evaluated by Régilait and is considered to be used in production conditions in its milk powder factory in Macon. Marine Damblon has
been recruited by Régilait for that. This collaboration will be extended in 2017 and a new master student should be recruited.</p>

          <p>Dur-Dur (Innovations agronomiques, techniques et organisationnelles pour

          <p>The Dur-Dur project develops a systematic approach to investigate the
questions related to the management of the nitrogen, energy and contaminants,
to guarantee a global quality of products throughout the production and the
processing chain. The knowledge representation task of Dur-Dur proposes to
map the stakeholders’ objectives into a multicriteria cartography, as well as
possible means to reach them, and computes the compatibility /
incompatibility of these objectives on the basis of argumentation methods.
The research methods used are qualitative and based both on argumentation
theory and on Social Multi- Criteria Evaluation (SMCE) theory. They will be
extended and adapted to the needs of the project to provide a formal
framework of assessment of the various orientations considered for the durum
wheat chain.</p>

          <p>Pack4Fresh (Sept. 2015 - Sept. 2017) is a project selected in the framework of the GloFood INRA-CIRAD metaprogramme. The multi-year metaprogramme GloFoodS (Transitions to global food security) is dedicated to the investigation of pathways to worldwide food security in a context of competition for land and natural resources, and is jointly conducted by INRA and Cirad, the two leading French research institutions for agriculture. Involving research on crop yield and livestock systems, land use changes, food processing and waste, nutrition and governance, GloFoodS aims at articulating global modeling of food supply and demand, with local issues of production and access to food.</p>
          <p>In this context, Pack4Fresh focuses on the big fragility of fresh foods which generates enormous post-harvest wastes, short shelf-life, and constitutes a major lock to their consumption and health benefit. This project aims at initiating an eco-design approach of the post-harvest phase of fresh foods working on the interdependency relation between environmental impact (1) positive for waste reduction, et (2) negative for technologies, which aims at reducing the waste, in order to minimize the ratio between those two parameters.</p>

          <p>OBDA-KeyVal is a one-year PEPS project (JCJC INS2I 2016, funded by CNRS-INS2I) dedicated to Ontology Based Data Access for NOSQL Databases. Its goal is to study the problem of answering ontology-mediated queries on top of non-relational databases, and more precisely Key-Value stores. These are a family of NOSQL databases dealing with data represented as nested-structures (JSON records), processed on distributed systems but also increasingly exchanged on the Web, slowly replacing XML and RDF formats. Key-value stores have been designed with performance and scalability in mind, and this opens the possibility to implement OBDA in a novel and efficient distributed setting. The work carried out in this project builds on our first results published at AAAI 2016 <ref xlink:href="#graphik-2016-bid6" location="biblio" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>, see also Sect. <ref xlink:href="#uid55" location="intern" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest"/>.
We addressed both practical and theoretical
aspects of OBDA for key-value stores. First, a prototype of the
reasoning framework for key-value stores has been developed
by master students (<ref xlink:href="https://github.com/OBDA-KEYVAL/graal-keyval" location="extern" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest">https://<allowbreak/>github.<allowbreak/>com/<allowbreak/>OBDA-KEYVAL/<allowbreak/>graal-keyval</ref>).
Second,
a novel first-order logic semantics for the setting (in contrast to
the former operational semantics) has been defined and investigated
from a decidability viewpoint. This still ongoing work is a necessary
step towards bridging this setting with the relational OBDA.</p>

          <p>NoAW (No Agricultural Waste) is an H2020 european project led by INRA-IATE, started in Oct. 2016.
Driven by a “near zero-waste” society requirement, the goal of NoAW project is to generate innovative efficient approaches to convert growing agricultural waste issues into eco-efficient bio-based products opportunities with direct benefits for both environment, economy and EU consumer. To achieve this goal, the NoAW concept relies on developing holistic life cycle thinking able to support environmentally responsible R&amp;D innovations on agro-waste conversion at different TRLs, in the light of regional and seasonal specificities, not forgetting risks emerging from circular management of agro-wastes (e.g. contaminants accumulation).</p>
          <p>GraphIK will contribute on two aspects. On one hand we will participate in the annotation effort of knowledge bases (using the @Web tool). On the other hand we will further investigate the interplay of argumentation with logically instantiated frameworks and its relation with social choice in the context of decision making.</p>

The aim of this work was to study and understand how Arrow's Impossibility Theorem (stating that there is no democratic voting rule) could be avoided thanks to deliberation and argumentation. More precisely, the favored approach was to define a formal framework of the deliberation process predating a vote, and to establish conditions under which deliberation may help to output a democratic and collectively rational choice through the notion of preference structuration, i.e.,the changes in preferences that the agents may undergo after discussion.</p>
